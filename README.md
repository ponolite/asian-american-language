# The Relationships between the Vocabulary in Famous Stream-of-Consciousness Novels and Mental Health

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation to understand the most repeated and dominant language used by transnational stream-of-consciousness authors-namely, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust and Fyodor Dostoevsky-to garner more information on their mental landscapes. Through the analysis of these authors' most famous works, we can gain insights into the portrayal of mental health themes such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and existential angst within the stream-of-consciousness genre. This exploration helps us in understand the shared linguistic patterns of the stream-of-consciousness genre and offers a glimpse into the authors' mental landscapes, shedding light on themes of self-identity and others.

## Data Extraction

I accessed data from the Kaggle website for Daily Statistics of the 2022 Iran Protests. Here is the link to the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/daily-statistics-of-the-2022-iran-protests?resource=download The data is behind a sign-in. To download the data, I scrolled down and download the Iran Protests Dataset (Ver 2.21.23).csv, and place it in my project data folder.

## Statement on LLM usage
