# The Dominant Vocabulary in Contemporary Asian-American Novels

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation to understand the most repeated and dominant language used by contemporary Asian-American authors to garner the current cultural status of Asian-Americans today. This helps us understand the current cultural language of the Asian-American population and related trends, especially in regards to racialization and more.

## Data Extraction

I accessed data from the Kaggle website for Daily Statistics of the 2022 Iran Protests. Here is the link to the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/daily-statistics-of-the-2022-iran-protests?resource=download The data is behind a sign-in. To download the data, I scrolled down and download the Iran Protests Dataset (Ver 2.21.23).csv, and place it in my project data folder.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
