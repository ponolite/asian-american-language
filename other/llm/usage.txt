why can't i have james joyce as a separate column in this dataset: frequency_male <- bind_rows(
                       mutate(swann_words, author = "Marcel Proust"),
                       mutate(dalloway_words, author = "Fyodor Dostoevsky"),
                       mutate(notes_words, author = "James Joyce")) |>
  mutate(word = str_extract(word, "[a-z']+")) |>
  count(author, word) |>
  group_by(author) |>
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) |>
  select(-n) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = author, values_from = proportion) |>
  pivot_longer(`Fyodor Dostoevsky`:`Marcel Proust`,
               names_to = "author", values_to = "proportion")

It seems like you're attempting to create a dataset that contains word frequencies for different authors, and you're encountering an issue with including James Joyce as a separate column.

From your code, it appears that you're using the pivot_wider function to pivot the data, and you're expecting James Joyce to be a separate column. However, since you're using pivot_longer with the range Fyodor Dostoevsky:Marcel Proust after pivot_wider, it's likely excluding James Joyce.

To include James Joyce as a separate column, you should adjust the pivot_longer function to include James Joyce as well. 

pivot_longer(`Fyodor Dostoevsky`:`James Joyce`,  # Include James Joyce here

aes(x = n, y = reorder(word, n))
The reorder(word, n) function inside aes() is used to reorder the words based on their frequency (n)

the color purple of this graph is too concentratred, i want the data point to be more visibile and disperse: frequency_female <- bind_rows(mutate(dalloway_words, author = "Virginia Woolf"),
                              mutate(bliss_words, author = "Katherine Mansfield"))
