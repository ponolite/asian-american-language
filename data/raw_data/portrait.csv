4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo....,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,glass: he had a hairy face.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lived: she sold lemon platt.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    O, the wild rose blossoms",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    On the little green place.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He sang that song. That was his song.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"When you wet the bed, first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the sailor’s hornpipe for him to dance. He danced:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Tralala lala,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Tralala tralaladdy,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Tralala lala,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,piece of tissue paper.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mother. They were Eileen’s father and mother. When they were grown up,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O, Stephen will apologise.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dante said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.—",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Pull out his eyes,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Apologise,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,    Apologise.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light. He kept on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,third line all the fellows said.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink. Rody,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Roche had big hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And one day he had asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What is your name?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen had answered: Stephen Dedalus.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then Nasty Roche had said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What kind of a name is that?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What is your father?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen had answered:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—A gentleman.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then Nasty Roche had asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Is he a magistrate?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with cold. He kept,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellow said to Cantwell:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I’d give you such a belt in a second.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Cantwell had answered:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I’d like to see,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you. He’d give you a toe in the rump for yourself.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him not to speak,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had pretended not to see that she was going to cry. She was a nice,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"had shaken hands with his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of the flashing",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through the legs. The fellows",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and stamping. Then Jack Lawton’s yellow boots dodged out the ball and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,home for the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would change,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,haha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,marks of the soldiers’ slugs in the wood of the door and had given him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Cornwell’s Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sentences to learn the spelling from.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    Where the abbots buried him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    Canker is a disease of plants,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    Cancer one of animals.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuffbox,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"for Wells’s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat jump,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,said that Dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman. And when Dante,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that was heartburn.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A voice cried far out on the playground:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—All in!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—All in! All in!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—We all know why you speak. You are McGlade’s suck.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect’s false sleeves behind his back,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,louder.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the playroom you could hear it.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and then said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lancaster!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums but he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall’s face looked,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,very black but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, York! Forge",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ahead!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sum and heard Father Arnall’s voice. Then all his eagerness passed away,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wondered whether the scullion’s apron was damp too or whether all white,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea;,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fathers and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed to be at home and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lay his head on his mother’s lap. But he could not: and so he longed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What’s up? Have you a pain or what’s up with you?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I don’t know, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks white.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It will go away.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O yes, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,night. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,going into a tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping;",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and the tables of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the third line. And every single fellow had a different way of walking.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,song of the gas. The prefect was at the door with some boys and Simon,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Moonan was knotting his false sleeves. He was telling them something,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,about Tullabeg.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen answered:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I do.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Wells turned to the other fellows and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of Wells’s mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,face. He did not like Wells’s face. It was Wells who had shouldered him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"little snuffbox for Wells’s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,jump plop into the scum.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,number pasted up inside from seventyseven to seventysix. But the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Christmas vacation was very far away: but one time it would come,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,because the earth moved round always.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante’s press, the brush with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,those colours. Fleming had done it himself.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could not learn the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,names of places in America. Still they were all different places that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had different names. They were all in different countries and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the world was in the universe.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,That was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod had written on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the opposite page:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. Then he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,name. That was he: and he read down the page again. What was after the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,universe? Nothing. But was there anything round the universe to show,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,where it stopped before the nothing place began? It could not be a wall,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only God could do,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he could,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,only think of God. God was God’s name just as his name was Stephen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,_Dieu_ was the French for God and that was God’s name too; and when,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,anyone prayed to God and said Dieu then God knew at once that it was a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,French person that was praying. But though there were different names,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,for God in all the different languages in the world and God understood,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,what all the people who prayed said in their different languages still,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,God remained always the same God and God’s real name was God.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel his head,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. He wondered which was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"right, to be for the green or for the maroon, because Dante had ripped",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,her scissors and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,if they were arguing at home about that. That was called politics.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and his father and Mr,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle Charles were on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,no side. Every day there was something in the paper about it.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was cold night air in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was cold day and night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dark under the seawall beside his father’s house. But the kettle would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,be on the hob to make punch.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,responses:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"    O Lord, open our lips",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there between the trees",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,how it was.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"  Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,  drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,  Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,  and may Thy blessing be always upon us through,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,  Christ our Lord. Amen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. He told,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and then kneel and say his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not go to hell when he died. He rolled his stockings off and put on his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"prayers quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shoulders shaking as he murmured:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    God bless my father and my mother and spare them to me!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    God bless Dante and uncle Charles and spare them to me!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he died; and the shaking would stop. A voice bade the boys in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dormitory goodnight. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all sides. The light was lowered quietly.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The prefect’s shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase and along the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the dark. Was it true about,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,carriagelamps? They said it was the ghost of a murderer. A long shiver,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of fear flowed over his body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,castle. Old servants in old dress were in the ironingroom above the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,staircase. It was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fire there but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,master’s face and cloak and knew that he had received his deathwound.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But only the dark was where they looked: only dark silent air. Their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,master had received his deathwound on the battlefield of Prague far,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,away over the sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to his side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of a marshal.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark was cold,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"carriagelamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,marshals who had received their deathwound on battlefields far away,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. They drove,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,merrily along the country roads. The drivers pointed with their whips,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Jolly Farmer. Cheer after cheer after cheer. Through Clane they drove,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cheering and cheered. The peasant women stood at the halfdoors, the men",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry air: the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and corduroy.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unlocking the doors. They were men in dark blue and silver; they had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Dedalus, don’t spy on us, sure you won’t?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Wells’s face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells was afraid.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I didn’t mean to. Sure you won’t?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He shook his head and answered no and felt glad.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Wells said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I didn’t mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I’m sorry.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was afraid. Afraid,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"It was not Wells’s face, it was the prefect’s. He was not foxing. No,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the prefect’s cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he was to get up and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dress and go to the infirmary. And while he was dressing himself as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,quickly as he could the prefect said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have the collywobbles!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him laugh. But he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery: and then,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the prefect had to laugh by himself.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The prefect cried:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the bath. As he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"warm turfcoloured bogwater, the warm moist air, the noise of plunges,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the smell of the towels, like medicine.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine. That,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,came from the bottles on the shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Michael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when they went in he called out:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Hello! It’s young Dedalus! What’s up?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—The sky is up, Brother Michael said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while Stephen was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring him a round of buttered",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Ah, do! he said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,the morning when the doctor comes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Will I? the fellow said. I’m not well yet.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Brother Michael repeated:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—You’ll get your walking papers. I tell you.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the long back of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellow out of third of grammar.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then Brother Michael went away and after a while the fellow out of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written home to tell,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his mother and father? But it would be quicker for one of the priests,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to go himself to tell them. Or he would write a letter for the priest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to bring.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,toll slowly.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song that Brigid,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had taught him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,    Dingdong! The castle bell!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words were where they,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,said _Bury me in the old churchyard!_ A tremor passed over his body.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,How sad and how beautiful! He wanted to cry quietly but not for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"himself: for the words, so beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bell! Farewell! O farewell!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bedside with a bowl of beeftea. He was glad for his mouth was hot and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,going on in the college just as if he were there.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the paper. He told Stephen that his name was Athy and that his father,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would give a good tip to Brother Michael any time he wanted it because,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Brother Michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind of news,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports and politics.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Now it is all about politics in the papers, he said. Do your people",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,talk about that too?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Yes, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Mine too, he said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then he thought for a moment and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You have a queer name, Dedalus, and I have a queer name too, Athy. My",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,name is the name of a town. Your name is like Latin.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then he asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Are you good at riddles?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen answered:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Not very good.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then he said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Can you answer me this one? Why is the county of Kildare like the leg,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of a fellow’s breeches?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen thought what could be the answer and then said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I give it up.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Because there is a thigh in it, he said. Do you see the joke? Athy is",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the town in the county Kildare and a thigh is the other thigh.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Oh, I see, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That’s an old riddle, he said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,After a moment he said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I say!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What? asked Stephen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You know, he said, you can ask that riddle another way.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Can you? said Stephen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—The same riddle, he said. Do you know the other way to ask it?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—No, said Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Can you not think of the other way? he said.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He looked at Stephen over the bedclothes as he spoke. Then he lay back,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,on the pillow and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—There is another way but I won’t tell you what it is.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, must be a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,magistrate too like Saurin’s father and Nasty Roche’s father. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"thought of his own father, of how he sang songs while his mother played",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys’,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fathers. Then why was he sent to that place with them? But his father,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had presented an address to the Liberator there fifty years before. You,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,could know the people of that time by their old dress. It seemed to him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a solemn time: and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Clongowes wore blue coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grownup people and kept,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,greyhounds of their own to course the hares with.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There would be cloudy grey light over the playgrounds. There was no,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,noise on the playgrounds. The class must be doing the themes or perhaps,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Father Arnall was reading out of the book.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was queer that they had not given him any medicine. Perhaps Brother,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Michael would bring it back when he came. They said you got stinking,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stuff to drink when you were in the infirmary. But he felt better now,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,than before. It would be nice getting better slowly. You could get a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,book then. There was a book in the library about Holland. There were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strangelooking cities and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ships. It made you feel so happy.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,How pale the light was at the window! But that was nice. The fire rose,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone had put coal on and he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,heard voices. They were talking. It was the noise of the waves. Or the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and falling, dark under",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the moonless night. A tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,waters’ edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour. A tall,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat dark land: and by",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the light at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Brother Michael.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,voice of sorrow over the waters:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—He is dead. We saw him lying upon the catafalque. A wail of sorrow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,went up from the people.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Parnell! Parnell! He is dead!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"They fell upon their knees, moaning in sorrow.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And he saw Dante in a maroon velvet dress and with a green velvet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,people who knelt by the water’s edge.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"A great fire, banked high and red, flamed in the grate and under the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,They had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready: but it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"would be ready in a jiffy, his mother had said. They were waiting for",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the door to open and for the servants to come in, holding the big",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dishes covered with their heavy metal covers.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"All were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the shadow of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the easychairs at either side of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the hearth, Stephen, seated on a chair between them, his feet resting",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,on the toasted boss. Mr Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"above the mantelpiece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his coat tails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still from",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat tail to wax out one of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one side and, smiling,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,for he knew now that it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,silver in his throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried to open Mr,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Casey’s hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that the fingers could not be straightened out: and Mr Casey had told,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,present for Queen Victoria. Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,smiled at Stephen with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Yes. Well now, that’s all right. O, we had a good walk, hadn’t we,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Ay, bedad.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—You didn’t stir out at all, Mrs Riordan?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dante frowned and said shortly:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—No.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Mr Dedalus dropped his coat tails and went over to the sideboard. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,brought forth a great stone jar of whisky from the locker and filled,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the procession to the little",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,censer had swung it gently to and fro near the door with the silvery,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cap lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. That was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow’s machine,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lightly on the cinderpath and his spectacles had been broken in three,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—Why?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Do you know?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Who told you?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Tell us, Athy.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself kicking a stone before him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Ask him, he said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The fellows looked there and then said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Why him?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Is he in it?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Athy lowered his voice and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you must not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,let on you know.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,night.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The fellows looked at him and asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Caught?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What doing?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Athy said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Smugging.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,All the fellows were silent: and Athy said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—And that’s why.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"was always at his nails, paring them.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl. They,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of _Tower of Ivory_,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,but protestants could not understand it and made fun of it. One day he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,running up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pocket where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,her hand was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,then all of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sloping curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed out behind her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,like gold in the sun. _Tower of Ivory. House of Gold._ By thinking of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,things you could understand them.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to do something.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there. And behind,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bearded man in a Roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was the name of the drawing:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,_Balbus was building a wall._,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny face but it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of another closet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,there was written in backhand in beautiful writing:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,_Julius Cæsar wrote The Calico Belly._,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Perhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it was queer what Athy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,said and the way he said it. It was not a cod because they had run,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,away. He looked with the others across the playground and began to feel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,afraid.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,At last Fleming said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—What is going to be done to them?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy said, and the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,expelled.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had spoken first.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. He’s going to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,be flogged by Mr Gleeson.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other fellows are",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Besides Gleeson won’t flog him hard.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—I wouldn’t like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker, Cecil Thunder said. But",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,twice nine.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—No, no, said Athy. They’ll both get it on the vital spot.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Wells rubbed himself and said in a crying voice:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Please, sir, let me off!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    It can’t be helped;,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    It must be done.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    So down with your breeches,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,    And out with your bum.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. In the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sounds. A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and cold: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, the master or",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it that way?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He looked at Athy’s rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nails. So long and cruel they were though the white fattish hands were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"him to think of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said; that Mr Gleeson would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was best of his play not to. But that was not why.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A voice from far out on the playground cried:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—All in!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And other voices cried:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—All in! All in!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listening to the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and fro making little,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,how to hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for himself,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,_Zeal without prudence is like a ship adrift._ But the lines of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the full curves of the capital.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rector’s breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,faint smell of the rector’s breath had made him feel a sick feeling on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But he said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which I made my",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first holy communion.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he remained still,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father Arnall gave out the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,themebooks and he said that they were scandalous and that they were all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to be written out again with the corrections at once. But the worst of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all was Fleming’s theme because the pages were stuck together by a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,blot: and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lawton to decline the noun _mare_ and Jack Lawton stopped at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ablative singular and could not go on with the plural.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall sternly. You,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the leader of the class!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. Nobody knew.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Father Arnall became very quiet, more and more quiet as each boy tried",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to answer it and could not. But his face was blacklooking and his eyes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Fleming said that the word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the book and shouted at him:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the idlest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of you.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,benches. The other boys bent over their themebooks and began to write.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"A silence filled the classroom and Stephen, glancing timidly at Father",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Arnall’s dark face, saw that it was a little red from the wax he was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,allowed because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,what because you would have to think of them in a different way with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and different kinds of hats.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran through the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant of dead silence and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk. Stephen’s heart,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,leapt up in fear.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the prefect of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his knees.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hand shook like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prayer to be let off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,limbs quivered with pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cry that scalded his throat.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Kneel down, cried the prefect of studies.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides. To,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone else’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that he felt sorry for. And as he knelt, calming the last sobs in his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides, he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fingers that shook helplessly in the air.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,The door closed behind him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father Arnall rose,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from his seat and went among them, helping the boys with gentle words",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and telling them the mistakes they had made. His voice was very gentle,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and soft. Then he returned to his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You may return to your places, you two.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat down.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly with one weak hand",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and bent down upon it, his face close to the page.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had said that he need not study,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,till the new glasses came. Then to be called a schemer before the class,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was the leader of the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that it was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect’s fingers as they,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,places without making any difference between them. He listened to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Father Arnall’s low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unfair. And his whitegrey face and the no-coloured eyes behind the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,steel rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,louder.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—It’s a stinking mean thing, that’s what it is, said Fleming in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn’t stand it. I’d go up and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the pandybat over",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Baldyhead. It’s a stinking mean low trick, that’s what it is. I’d go",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of them said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been wrongly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,punished.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel; and, as he sat in the refectory,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,little mirror to see. But there could not be; and it was unjust and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cruel and unfair.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on Wednesdays in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it. Yes, he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would do what the fellows had told him. He would go up and tell the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rector that he had been wrongly punished. A thing like that had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"done before by somebody in history, by some great person whose head was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people always,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished. Those,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnall’s Questions.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,History was all about those men and what they did and that was what,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Peter Parley’s Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road over a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fast along the road to Greece and Rome.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had nothing to do but that; to turn to the right and walk fast up the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corridor that led through the castle to the rector’s room. And every,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,What would happen? He heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the fifth was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Gleeson. That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the tears, he watched big Corrigan’s broad shoulders and big hanging",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,black head passing in the file. But he had done something and besides,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,looked in the bath. He had skin the same colour as the turfcoloured,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,thighs shook a little because he was fat.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,file. He could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a prefect outside the refectory door. But he could not go. The rector,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellow going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to go,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all about it. No,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"had only said he would come in. No, it was best to hide out of the way",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,because when you were small and young you could often escape that way.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed out among,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming near the door. If he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,could not leave the playground for that. And if he went and was pandied,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was impossible: he could not. He thought of the baldy head of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prefect of studies with the cruel no-coloured eyes looking at him and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,name was. Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the name? The great men in the history had names like that and nobody,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,made fun of them. It was his own name that he should have made fun of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it was like the name of a woman who,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,washed clothes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the right, walked up",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the stairs; and, before he could make up his mind to come back, he had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle. And as he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw, without",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"turning his head to look, that all the fellows were looking after him",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,as they went filing by.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little doors that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were the doors of the rooms of the community. He peered in front of him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,portraits. It was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tears so that he could not see. But he thought they were the portraits,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,soldiers’ slugs were there. And it was there that the old servants had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He asked him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,where was the rector’s room and the old servant pointed to the door at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when he heard a muffled voice say:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Come in!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the green baize door inside. He found it and pushed it open and went,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,chairs.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the silence of the room: and he looked at the skull and at the rector’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,kind-looking face.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—I broke my glasses, sir.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—O!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—Quite right! said the rector.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—No, sir.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,say that I excuse you from your lessons for a few days.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall speak to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Father Dolan myself. Will that do now?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—O yes sir, thanks.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Good day, sir, said Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,carefully and slowly.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster. Faster,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly. He bumped his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"elbow against the door at the end and, hurrying down the staircase,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. He broke,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran across the cinderpath",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and reached the third line playground, panting.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—Tell us! Tell us!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What did he say?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Did you go in?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,—Tell us! Tell us!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He told them what he had said and what the rector had said and, when he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"had told them, all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,air and cried:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Hurroo!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning skyhigh and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cried again:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Hurroo! Hurroo!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and carried him along till he struggled to get free. And when he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"escaped from them they broke away in all directions, flinging their",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,crying:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Hurroo!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three cheers for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Clongowes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He was happy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and free: but he would not be anyway proud with Father Dolan. He would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,be very quiet and obedient: and he wished that he could do something,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,kind for him to show him that he was not proud.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming. There was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the smell of evening in the air, the smell of the fields in the country",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"out for a walk to Major Barton’s, the smell there was in the little",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wood beyond the pavilion where the gallnuts were.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the balls:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his nephew suggested,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the garden.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tranquilly.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,salubrious.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if I know how you can smoke such",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"villainous awful tobacco. It’s like gunpowder, by God.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—It’s very nice, Simon, replied the old man. Very cool and mollifying.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse but",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,brushed and put on his tall hat. While he smoked the brim of his tall,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"outhouse door. His arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse which he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shared with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,soundingbox: and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"favourite songs: _O, twine me a bower_ or _Blue eyes and golden hair_",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,or _The Groves of Blarney_ while the grey and blue coils of smoke rose,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen’s constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"well tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he did messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,outside the counter. He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"grandnephew’s hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on Stephen’s",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They’re good for your bowels.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"where an old friend of Stephen’s father, Mike Flynn, would be found",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen’s run",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,blue canvas shoes. A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"trainer’s flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the pouch.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and, as the font was above Stephen’s reach, the old man would dip his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen’s clothes and on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the floor of the porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prayerbook wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen knelt at his side respecting, though he did not share, his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,piety. He often wondered what his granduncle prayed for so seriously.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a part of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,On Sundays Stephen with his father and his granduncle took their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,village of Stillorgan was the parting of the ways. Either they went to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the left towards the Dublin mountains or along the Goatstown road and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"thence into Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the road",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish politics, of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which Stephen",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nature of which he only dimly apprehended.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,_The Count of Monte Cristo_. The figure of that dark avenger stood,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,forth in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the strange and terrible. At night he built up on the parlour table an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Marseilles, of sunny trellises and of Mercedes.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Outside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"this house, he told himself, another Mercedes lived. Both on the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a long train of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the close",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"had read of Napoleon’s plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays into the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the shaggy weedgrown rocks, coming home after it weary stragglers with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,milkcar to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,round the field. But when autumn came the cows were driven home from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"troughs, sickened Stephen’s heart. The cattle which had seemed so",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,even look at the milk they yielded.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,round with the car which delivered the evening milk: and these chilly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman’s coat.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his trainer’s flabby stubblecovered face as it bent heavily over his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare’s hoofs,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,swaying and rattling behind him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,seek it or how but a premonition which led him on told him that this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade into,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"something impalpable under her eyes and then in a moment, he would be",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience would fall from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him in that magic moment.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"redeyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the family portraits leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shed a weak light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,vanmen. Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was being",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort and reverie of Blackrock,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the passage through the gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and again an intuition, a foreknowledge of the future came to him. He",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug, with his back",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and eat his dinner.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—There’s a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, said Mr",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive me) nor half dead.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles had grown so,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,witless that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in settling in the new house left Stephen freer than he had been in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Blackrock. In the beginning he contented himself with circling timidly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"round the neighbouring square or, at most, going half way down one of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the side streets but when he had made a skeleton map of the city in his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mind he followed boldly one of its central lines until he reached the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Custom House. He passed unchallenged among the docks and along the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,quays wondering at the multitude of corks that lay bobbing on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"surface of the water in a thick yellow scum, at the crowds of quay",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,porters and the rumbling carts and the illdressed bearded policeman.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of steamers wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wandering in the evening from garden to garden in search of Mercedes.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And amid this new bustling life he might have fancied himself in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,another Marseilles but that he missed the bright sky and the sun-warmed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,trellises of the wineshops. A vague dissatisfaction grew up within him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and yet he continued to wander up and down day after day as if he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,really sought someone that eluded him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,though they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Christmas his mood of embittered silence did not leave him. The causes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of his embitterment were many, remote and near. He was angry with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"himself for being young and the prey of restless foolish impulses,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,angry also with the change of fortune which was reshaping the world,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his anger lent,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his aunt was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees. She,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crookedly under his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"stone of coal, heard her words. He dropped his load promptly on the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,floor and hurried to her side to see. He mauled the edges of the paper,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with his reddened and blackened hands, shouldering her aside and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,complaining that he could not see.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,darkwindowed house. The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,window a spectral dusk was gathering upon the river. Before the fire an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"old woman was busy making tea and, as she bustled at the task, she told",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said. She told too,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sayings. He sat listening to the words and following the ways of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults and winding",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,galleries and jagged caverns.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A skull appeared,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A feeble creature like a monkey,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"was there, drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire. A whining",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,voice came from the door asking:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Is that Josephine?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—O... O, good evening, Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Do you want anything, Ellen? asked the old woman at the fire.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"in the games. The children, wearing the spoils of their crackers,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"danced and romped noisily and, though he tried to share their",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"merriment, he felt himself a gloomy figure amid the gay cocked hats and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sunbonnets.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"room he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. The mirth, which in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial, was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"like a soothing air to him, passing gaily by his senses, hiding from",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"they went together towards the tram, sprays of her fresh warm breath",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,glassy road.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. On the empty",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,footsteps came up or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"on the upper step, forgetting to go down, and then went down. His heart",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,danced upon her movements like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and knew that in some dim,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"past, whether in life or reverie, he had heard their tale before. He",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long black",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times. Yet a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart, asking him",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking into the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lawn, and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"laughter and had run down the sloping curve of the path. Now, as then,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"he stood listlessly in his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and a new emerald",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,exercise. From force of habit he had written at the top of the first,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,page the initial letters of the jesuit motto: A.M.D.G. On the first,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,line of the page appeared the title of the verses he was trying to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,write: To E—— C——. He knew it was right to begin so for he had seen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,similar titles in the collected poems of Lord Byron. When he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a daydream and began to draw diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the discussion,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"at the Christmas dinner table, trying to write a poem about Parnell on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,those elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,scene. There remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the trammen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nor of the horses: nor did he and she appear vividly. The verses told,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,only of the night and the balmy breeze and the maiden lustre of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,moon. Some undefined sorrow was hidden in the hearts of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had been withheld",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the window,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lines of Chinese lanterns were stretched. He watched the visitors come,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"evening dress, old Belvedereans, loitered in groups about the entrance",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to the theatre and ushered in the visitors with ceremony. Under the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sudden glow of a lantern he could recognise the smiling face of a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,priest.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the space before it free. Against the walls stood companies of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,barbells and Indian clubs; the dumbbells were piled in one corner: and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the midst of countless hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood the stout leatherjacketed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage and set,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay writing he had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"been elected secretary to the gymnasium, had had no part in the first",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,section of the programme but in the play which formed the second,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"section he had the chief part, that of a farcical pedagogue. He had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been cast for it on account of his stature and grave manners for he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,now at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A score of the younger boys in white knickers and singlets came,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"pattering down from the stage, through the vestry and into the chapel.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The vestry and chapel were peopled with eager masters and boys. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot the springboard of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the vaulting horse. The lean young man in a long overcoat, who was to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"give a special display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with interest, his silver-coated clubs peeping out of his deep",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sidepockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden dumbbells was heard as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in another moment,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"flock of geese, flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to the laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"were practising their steps at the end of the chapel, some circling",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"their arms above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,violets and curtseying. In a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,side of the altar a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"When she stood up a pinkdressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"an oldfashioned straw sunbonnet, with black pencilled eyebrows and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish figure.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the dark",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, Mrs",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Tallon?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of the bonnet, he exclaimed:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—No! Upon my word I believe it’s little Bertie Tallon after all!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,laugh together and heard the boys’ murmurs of admiration behind him as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sunbonnet dance by himself. A movement of impatience escaped him. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"let the edge of the blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which he had been standing, walked out of the chapel.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the garden. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,audience and sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers’ band. The light,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,spread upwards from the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ark, anchored among the hulks of houses, her frail cables of lanterns",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,looping her to her moorings. A side door of the theatre opened suddenly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and a shaft of light flew across the grassplots. A sudden burst of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the side",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"music. The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and supple",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"movement, evoked the incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all his day’s unrest and of his impatient movement of a moment before.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His unrest issued from him like a wave of sound: and on the tide of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"flowing music the ark was journeying, trailing her cables of lanterns",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the movement. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stage.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"aromatic odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"smoking, and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,voice.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. Welcome to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,our trusty friend!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,friend.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,instead:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be tonight if,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ripping good joke.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly. _He that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,will not hear the churcha let him be to theea as the heathena and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,publicana._,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his mouth and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It’s always getting stuck like,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that. Do you use a holder?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I don’t smoke, answered Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn’t smoke and he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,doesn’t go to bazaars and he doesn’t flirt and he doesn’t damn anything,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,or damn all.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival’s flushed and mobile,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"face, beaked like a bird’s. He had often thought it strange that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Vincent Heron had a bird’s face as well as a bird’s name. A shock of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the closeset,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive. The rivals were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"school friends. They sat together in class, knelt together in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As the fellows",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"in number one were undistinguished dullards, Stephen and Heron had been",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor going in.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The smile waned on Stephen’s face. Any allusion made to his father by a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"timorous silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—You’re a sly dog.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Why so? said Stephen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You’d think butter wouldn’t melt in your mouth, said Heron. But I’m",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,afraid you’re a sly dog.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen urbanely.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, didn’t we? And",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,deucedly pretty she is too. And inquisitive! _And what part does,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen take, Mr Dedalus? And will Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?_ Your",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,governor was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,worth so that I think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn’t,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"care a bit, by Jove. She’s ripping, isn’t she, Wallis?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,more in a corner of his mouth.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen’s mind at these,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nothing amusing in a girl’s interest and regard. All day he had thought,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of nothing but their leavetaking on the steps of the tram at Harold’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Cross, the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the poem he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"night of the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we’ve fairly found you",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"out this time. You can’t play the saint on me any more, that’s one sure",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,five.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen’s moment of anger had already passed. He was neither flattered,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nor confused but simply wished the banter to end. He scarcely resented,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words: and his face,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mirrored his rival’s false smile.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion’s",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"jesting mood, began to recite the _Confiteor_. The episode ended well,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of an undivined and squalid way of life. His soul was still disquieted,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had emerged from a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,two years’ spell of reverie to find himself in the midst of a new,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"scene, every event and figure of which affected him intimately,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"disheartened him or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which his school life left him was passed in the company of subversive,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,writers whose gibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his neck and wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak. He was conscious of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"failure and of detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"between his two attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Stephen listened to them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him. He had not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,been in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the dark and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,He mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"question of honour here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him. While his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to be a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all things. These voices had now come to be hollowsounding in his ears.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,When the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and tradition. In the profane world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"would bid him raise up his father’s fallen state by his labours and,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fellow, to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all these,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hollowsounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"he was far from them, beyond their call, alone or in the company of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,aware of some desecration of the priest’s office or of the vestry,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,thought of the part he had to play humiliated him. A remembrance of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted cheeks. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"players, he shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hauled upwards by two ablebodied priests with violent jerks and all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It surprised him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the void of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ark a few lanterns swung in the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and stares and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nudges which his powdered head left in its wake.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of the group was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,familiar and ran down the steps angrily.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I have to leave a message down in George’s Street, he said to his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,father quickly. I’ll be home after you.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Without waiting for his father’s questions he ran across the road and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He hardly knew where he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was walking. Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sent up vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,strode down the hill amid the tumult of suddenrisen vapours of wounded,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pride and fallen hope and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his anguished eyes in dense and maddening fumes and passed away above,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him till at last the air was clear and cold again.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A power, akin",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him, brought",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his steps to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the morgue and from that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,saw the word _Lotts_ on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rank heavy air.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a good odour to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Stephen was once again seated beside his father in the corner of a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his father by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of the station he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first day at Clongowes. But he felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lands slipping away past him, the silent telegraphpoles passing his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"window swiftly every four seconds, the little glimmering stations,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"manned by a few silent sentries, flung by the mail behind her and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,backwards by a runner.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He listened without sympathy to his father’s evocation of Cork and of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,flask whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the evoker remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit. Stephen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,heard but could feel no pity. The images of the dead were all strangers,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately been",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father’s property was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"going to be sold by auction, and in the manner of his own dispossession",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train had passed out,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cold light of the dawn lay over the country, over the unpeopled fields",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the closed cottages. The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,watched the silent country or heard from time to time his father’s deep,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,breath or sudden sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen sleepers,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"filled him with strange dread, as though they could harm him, and he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"prayed that the day might come quickly. His prayer, addressed neither",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to God nor saint, began with a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"crept through the chink of the carriage door to his feet, and ended in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent rhythm of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,telegraphpoles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"windowledge, he let his eyelids close again.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early morning and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the Victoria Hotel. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bright warm sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the din of traffic. His father was standing before the dressingtable,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"examining his hair and face and moustache with great care, craning his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,neck across the waterjug and drawing it back sideways to see the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,better. While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,tender tremors with which his father’s voice festooned the strange sad,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"happy air, drove off all the mists of the night’s ill humour from",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen’s brain. He got up quickly to dress and, when the song had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ended, said:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cross-examined the waiter for local news. For the most part they spoke,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"at cross purposes when a name was mentioned, the waiter having in mind",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the present holder and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Well, I hope they haven’t moved the Queen’s College anyhow, said Mr",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered the grounds of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But their progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dozen or so paces by some reply of the porter’s.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,By the time they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to fever. He wondered how his father, whom he knew for a shrewd",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"suspicious man, could be duped by the servile manners of the porter;",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen remained in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,desk he read the word _Fœtus_ cut several times in the dark stained,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wood. The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"company. A vision of their life, which his father’s words had been",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word cut in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,desk. A broadshouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"letters with a jackknife, seriously. Other students stood or sat near",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"turned on him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tan boots.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen’s name was called. He hurried down the steps of the theatre so,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and, peering",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"closely at his father’s initials, hid his flushed face.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,across the quadrangle and towards the college gate. It shocked him to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,brutish and individual malady of his own mind. His monstrous reveries,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"came thronging into his memory. They too had sprung up before him,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"suddenly and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wondering",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"always where they came from, from what den of monstrous images, and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"always weak and humble towards others, restless and sickened of himself",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,revellers who had been the companions of his father’s youth. And a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,faint sickness sighed in his heart. He recalled his own equivocal,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid of his own",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind. The letters cut,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephen—at least I hope we",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,were—and bloody good honest Irishmen too. That’s the kind of fellows I,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"away from home to a college, he had made his first communion and eaten",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,slim jim out of his cricketcap and watched the firelight leaping and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"being dead, of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"gold cope, of being buried then in the little graveyard of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,community off the main avenue of limes. But he had not died then.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,no procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sun. He had been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,existed. How strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"way, not by death but by fading out in the sun or by being lost and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,forgotten somewhere in the universe! It was strange to see his small,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,body appear again for a moment: a little boy in a grey belted suit. His,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hands were in his sidepockets and his trousers were tucked in at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"father flirted, the compliments and encouraging words of his father’s",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,friends. They had told him that he had a great look of his grandfather,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him admit that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the Lee was a much finer river than the Liffey. One of them, in order",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to put his Latin to the proof, had made him translate short passages",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past. An abyss,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of fortune or of temperament sundered him from them. His mind seemed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,older than theirs: it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,regrets like a moon upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him as it had stirred in them. He had known neither the pleasure of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor filial,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,capable of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen’s mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the steps,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and along the colonnade where the Highland sentry was parading. When,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter Stephen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and three pounds; and these sums, the moneys of his exhibition and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in notes and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with feigned,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his father chatted,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,career in after life. He was impatient of their voices and could not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,keep his feet at rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,like giving a boy the best education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lingered in the hall gazing about him and up at the roof and telling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,standing at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,eyes. Stephen looked at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen’s fingers. Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fruits arrived from the city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to see _Ingomar_ or _The Lady of Lyons_. In his coat pockets he carried,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,squares of Vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers’ pocket,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds of price lists,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of it held some office, opened a loan bank for his family and pressed",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink enamel paint gave,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sister. He felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he was in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him to realise the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred. He bore cynically,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes. By day and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"night through the winding darkness of sleep, her face transfigured by a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy. Only the morning",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,avenues of Blackrock. But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lights in the windows poured a tender influence upon him now. Only at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"times, in the pauses of his desire, when the luxury that was wasting",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"him gave room to a softer languor, the image of Mercedes traversed the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,background of his memory. He saw again the small white house and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,garden of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains and he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"there, standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,estrangement and adventure. At those moments the soft speeches of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest. A tender,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,timidity and inexperience were to fall from him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,brutal words rushed forth from his brain to force a passage. His blood,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was in revolt. He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"into the gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving irresistibly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of drunken singers. He walked onward, undismayed, wondering whether he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had strayed into the quarter of the jews. Women and girls dressed in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vision against the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before the doors and in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite. He was in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,She said gaily:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Good night, Willie dear!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her legs apart in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the copious easychair beside the bed. He tried to bid his tongue speak,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that he might seem at ease, watching her as she undid her gown, noting",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms held him firmly to her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and he, seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"warm calm rise and fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,weeping. Tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lips parted though they would not speak.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held firmly in her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"arms, to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her arms he felt that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he had suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself. But his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lips would not bend to kiss her.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"was too much for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of her softly parting lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker than the swoon of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its dull day,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and as he stared through the dull square of the window of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,schoolroom he felt his belly crave for its food. He hoped there would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour-fattened sauce.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the yellow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down the streets,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. The whores would be just,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,will or a sudden call to his sin-loving soul from their soft perfumed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"flesh. Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them;",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock’s; and, when the eyes",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,itself together again. The indices appearing and disappearing were eyes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,opening and closing; the eyes opening and closing were stars being born,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and being quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley’s fragment upon the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. The stars began to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first violent sin,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his body or his soul maimed by the excess. Instead the vital wave had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,established between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had sinned,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment. His days and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"works and thoughts could make no atonement for him, the fountains of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul. At most, by an",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a certain awe,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night though he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,knew it was in God’s power to take away his life while he slept and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy. His pride in his own,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sin, his loveless awe of God, told him that his offence was too",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On Sunday,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling-desk at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,responses. The falsehood of his position did not pain him. If at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,condemnation. The sentence of saint James which says that he who,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,silently. The rector entered and took his seat on the dais. A gentle,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,difficult question.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confession will be heard all the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,afternoon after beads. If any boys have special confessors perhaps it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,will be better for them not to change. Mass will be on Saturday morning,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,at nine o’clock and general communion for the whole college. Saturday,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,will be a free day. But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,might be inclined to think that Monday is a free day also. Beware of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in Paris where Francis,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Xavier was professor of philosophy at the university. This young and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,brilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ideas of our glorious founder and you know that he, at his own desire,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"was sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, baptising the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,people. He is said to have baptised as many as ten thousand idolaters,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in one month. It is said that his right arm had grown powerless from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptised.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,what it had hidden. He ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"meal was over and the grease-strewn plates lay abandoned on the table,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"he rose and went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the end; and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind. He pressed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,darkening street. Forms passed this way and that through the dull,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,light. And that was life. The letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"upon his mind, pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slow",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,boorish insistence. His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"dusk, while the body that was his stood, listless and dishonoured,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,suffered its agony. He felt the deathchill touch the extremities and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"bright centres of the brain extinguished one by one like lamps, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and sighing, gurgling",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! He—he himself—his body to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which he had yielded was dying. Into the grave with it. Nail it down,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"into a wooden box, the corpse. Carry it out of the house on the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shoulders of hirelings. Thrust it out of men’s sight into a long hole,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"time to reflect, the body had died and the soul stood terrified before",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"just. He had long been patient, pleading with the sinful soul, giving",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"it time to repent, sparing it yet awhile. But that time had gone. Time",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"was to sin and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at the warnings",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"soul. One single instant after the body’s death, the soul had been",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,weighed in the balance. The particular judgement was over and the soul,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,of that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended God has,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners. Hell is a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"strait and dark and foulsmelling prison, an abode of demons and lost",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"souls, filled with fire and smoke. The straitness of this prison house",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is expressly designed by God to punish those who refused to be bound by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"awful prison, the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,plagues with which the land of the Pharaohs were smitten one plague,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"alone, that of darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"very air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. Consider then what must be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest physical",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,torment to which the damned are subjected. The torment of fire is the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,greatest torment to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,creatures. Place your finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you will feel the pain of fire. But our earthly fire was created by God,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"for the benefit of man, to maintain in him the spark of life and to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,help him in the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,quality and was created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sinner. Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible so that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparations,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphurous brimstone which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,burns in hell is a substance which is specially designed to burn for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ever and for ever with unspeakable fury. Moreover, our earthly fire",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,destroys at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the shorter is its duration; but the fire of hell has this property,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that it preserves that which it burns and though it rages with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,incredible intensity it rages for ever.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it may be,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is always of a limited extent: but the lake of fire in hell is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the devil",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was obliged to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hell it would be burned up in an instant like a piece of wax. And this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,terrible fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"without, but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself, the boundless",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fire raging in its very vitals. O, how terrible is the lot of those",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"wretched beings! The blood seethes and boils in the veins, the brains",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"are boiling in the skull, the heart in the breast glowing and bursting,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the bowels a redhot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,molten balls.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike. It is a fire,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which proceeds directly from the ire of God, working not of its own",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,activity but as an instrument of divine vengeance. As the waters of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"baptism cleanse the soul with the body, so do the fires of punishment",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,torture the spirit with the flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and every faculty of the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"utter darkness, the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"howls and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and spikes,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several torments of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,offended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ever-increasing fury by the breath of the anger of the Godhead.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,by the company of the damned themselves. Evil company on earth is so,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"noxious that the plants, as if by instinct, withdraw from the company",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them. In hell all laws are,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"overturned—there is no thought of family or country, of ties, of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"relationships. The damned howl and scream at one another, their torture",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging like,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and of hatred,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls which were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,their accomplices in sin. In olden times it was the custom to punish,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the parricide, the man who had raised his murderous hand against his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"father, by casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack in which",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"were placed a cock, a monkey, and a serpent. The intention of those",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"law-givers who framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beasts.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the fury of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,execration which bursts from the parched lips and aching throats of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,damned in hell when they behold in their companions in misery those who,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"aided and abetted them in sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of evil thinking and evil living in their minds, those whose immodest",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"suggestions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted and allured",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those accomplices and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless and hopeless: it is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,too late now for repentance.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned souls,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"will afflict the damned in two ways, by their presence and by their",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,reproaches. We can have no idea of how horrible these devils are. Saint,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Catherine of Siena once saw a devil and she has written that, rather",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster, she",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"coals. These devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and jeer at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the foul demons,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,who are made in hell the voices of conscience. Why did you sin? Why did,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you lend an ear to the temptings of friends? Why did you turn aside,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from your pious practices and good works? Why did you not shun the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,occasions of sin? Why did you not leave that evil companion? Why did,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"listen to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth or,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to God who only",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,waited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins? Now the time,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"for repentance has gone by. Time is, time was, but time shall be no",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"more! Time was to sin in secrecy, to indulge in that sloth and pride,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to covet the unlawful, to yield to the promptings of your lower nature,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to live like the beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"field, for they, at least, are but brutes and have no reason to guide",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"them: time was, but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so many",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"voices, but you would not hear. You would not crush out that pride and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"anger in your heart, you would not restore those ill-gotten goods, you",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to your,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"religious duties, you would not abandon those wicked companions, you",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would not avoid those dangerous temptations. Such is the language of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"those fiendish tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"they sinned, sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, even they,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"the overcoats and waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and dripping and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"had understood: and human life lay around him, a plain of peace whereon",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"antlike men laboured in brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mounds. The elbow of his companion touched him and his heart was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"than a little wind, and yet, listening and suffering silently, he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,among his school companions. Far away from there in some dark place he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would murmur out his own shame; and he besought God humbly not to be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,offended with him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, to make what",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to imagine with the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"senses of the mind, in our imagination, the material character of that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,awful place and of the physical torments which all who are in hell,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,endure. This evening we shall consider for a few moments the nature of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the spiritual torments of hell.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts, to that which",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is gross and beastlike; and it is also a turning away from the counsel,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of our higher nature, from all that is pure and holy, from the Holy God",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Himself. For this reason mortal sin is punished in hell by two,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"different forms of punishment, physical and spiritual.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater than",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the church, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst damnation consists",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in this that the understanding of man is totally deprived of divine,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,light and his affection obstinately turned away from the goodness of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"God. God, remember, is a being infinitely good, and therefore the loss",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be, but the damned in",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hell, for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which they have lost, and understand that they have lost it through",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very instant of death,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once flies,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"towards God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my dear",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from God, we live",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably His. God loves with a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,divine love every human soul and every human soul lives in that love.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"How could it be otherwise? Every breath that we draw, every thought of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"our brain, every instant of life proceeds from God’s inexhaustible",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"goodness. And if it be pain for a mother to be parted from her child,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"for a man to be exiled from hearth and home, for friend to be sundered",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from friend, O think what pain, what anguish it must be for the poor",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,soul to be spurned from the presence of the supremely good and loving,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Creator Who has called that soul into existence from nothingness and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love. This,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"then, to be separated for ever from its greatest good, from God, and to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"feel the anguish of that separation, knowing full well that it is",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unchangeable: this is the greatest torment which the created soul is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"capable of bearing, _pœna damni_, the pain of loss.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in hell is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are engendered by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"putrefaction, so in the souls of the lost there arises a perpetual",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"remorse from the putrefaction of sin, the sting of conscience, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"worm, as Pope Innocent the Third calls it, of the triple sting. The",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first sting inflicted by this cruel worm will be the memory of past,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pleasures. O what a dreadful memory will that be! In the lake of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"alldevouring flame the proud king will remember the pomps of his court,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of research, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lover of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"treasures, he who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"feasts, his dishes prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"miser will remember his hoard of gold, the robber his illgotten wealth,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the angry and revengeful and merciless murderers their deeds of blood,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and violence in which they revelled, the impure and adulterous the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unspeakable and filthy pleasures in which they delighted. They will,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins. For how,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in hellfire for ages and ages. How they will rage and fume to think,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that they have lost the bliss of heaven for the dross of earth, for a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"few pieces of metal, for vain honours, for bodily comforts, for a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this is the second,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless sorrow for sins",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,committed. Divine justice insists that the understanding of those,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,miserable wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which they were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"guilty, and moreover, as saint Augustine points out, God will impart to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"them His own knowledge of sin, so that sin will appear to them in all",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,its hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself. They will,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will be too,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,late and then they will bewail the good occasions which they neglected.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,This is the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,conscience. The conscience will say: You had time and opportunity to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,repent and would not. You were brought up religiously by your parents.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,You had the sacraments and grace and indulgences of the church to aid,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"you. You had the minister of God to preach to you, to call you back",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"when you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no matter how many, how",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. You would not.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you turned your back on the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"confessional, you wallowed deeper and deeper in the mire of sin. God",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"appealed to you, threatened you, entreated you to return to Him. O,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"what shame, what misery! The Ruler of the universe entreated you, a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"creature of clay, to love Him Who made you and to keep His law. No. You",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"would not. And now, though you were to flood all hell with your tears",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"if you could still weep, all that sea of repentance would not gain for",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you what a single tear of true repentance shed during your mortal life,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would have gained for you. You implore now a moment of earthly life,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wherein to repent: in vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Such is the threefold sting of conscience, the viper which gnaws the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"very heart’s core of the wretches in hell, so that filled with hellish",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fury they curse themselves for their folly and curse the evil,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,companions who have brought them to such ruin and curse the devils who,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tempted them in life and now mock them in eternity and even revile and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,curse the Supreme Being Whose goodness and patience they scorned and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is the pain,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be capable of many",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"evils, is not capable of them all at once, inasmuch as one evil",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,corrects and counteracts another just as one poison frequently corrects,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"another. In hell, on the contrary, one torment, instead of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"counteracting another, lends it still greater force: and, moreover, as",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the internal faculties are more perfect than the external senses, so",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,are they more capable of suffering. Just as every sense is afflicted,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with a fitting torment, so is every spiritual faculty; the fancy with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"horrible images, the sensitive faculty with alternate longing and rage,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,than the exterior darkness which reigns in that dreadful prison. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Confess! It was not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prayer. He had to kneel before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tell,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,over his hidden sins truly and repentantly. Before he heard again the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to let,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the footpath of that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,street and so many streets in that city and so many cities in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in mortal sin. Even once was a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mortal sin. It could happen in an instant. But how so quickly? By,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"seeing or by thinking of seeing. The eyes see the thing, without having",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wished first to see. Then in an instant it happens. But does that part,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of the body understand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the field. It must understand when it desires in one instant and then,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"that, a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,itself out of the tender marrow of his life and fattening upon the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragrance,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded workmen with pious,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"faces were guiding a canopy out through a side door, the sacristan",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,aiding them with quiet gestures and words. A few of the faithful still,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lingered praying before one of the sidealtars or kneeling in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,benches near the confessionals. He approached timidly and knelt at the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"last bench in the body, thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shadow of the church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. Jesus too,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of a carpenter,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cutting boards and planing them, and had first spoken of the kingdom of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,was foul with sin and he dared not ask forgiveness with the simple,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"trust of those whom Jesus, in the mysterious ways of God, had called",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Two penitents rose and entered the confessional at either side. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,the first penitent had knelt. The faint murmur began again.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one foot before",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run swiftly through",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! Little fiery,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"helpless, would cease to be.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the farther side of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,penitent had come out. A soft whispering noise floated in vaporous,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"cloudlets out of the box. It was the woman: soft whispering cloudlets,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"soft whispering vapour, whispering and vanishing.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,would kneel and pray with others and be happy. God would look down on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,It was easy to be good. God’s yoke was sweet and light. It was better,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"never to have sinned, to have remained always a child, for God loved",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,a sad thing to sin. But God was merciful to poor sinners who were truly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sorry. How true that was! That was indeed goodness.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He was next. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stood up in terror and walked blindly into the box.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could see that he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession would be long, long.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Everybody in the chapel would know then what a sinner he had been. Let,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them know. It was true. But God had promised to forgive him if he was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sorry. He was sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"white form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost creature,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; yet the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,unearthly texture that they seemed to him as hueless and odourless as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"faith in the Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that one of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,of it day by day the seven deadly sins which had defiled it in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"it would descend upon him, though it seemed strange to him at times",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been raised up,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person of the Most,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Whom was a sin beyond forgiveness, the eternal mysterious secret Being",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the Three Persons,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the books of devotion,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which he read—the Father contemplating from all eternity as in a mirror,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His Divine Perfections and thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and the Holy Spirit proceeding out of Father and Son from all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,eternity—were easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,august incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"world, for ages before the world itself had existed.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set forth",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,solemnly in books and had wondered why his soul was unable to harbour,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them for any time or to force his lips to utter their names with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,conviction. A brief anger had often invested him but he had never been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,able to make it an abiding passion and had always felt himself passing,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out of it as if his very body were being divested with ease of some,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"outer skin or peel. He had felt a subtle, dark, and murmurous presence",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it, too,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,would harbour.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love, since God",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself had loved his individual soul with divine love from all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with spiritual knowledge,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he saw the whole world forming one vast symmetrical expression of God’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,power and love. Life became a divine gift for every moment and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sensation of which, were it even the sight of a single leaf hanging on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the twig of a tree, his soul should praise and thank the Giver. The",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,world for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand why it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was in any way necessary that he should continue to live. Yet that was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"part of the divine purpose and he dared not question its use, he above",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all others who had sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,purpose. Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"pieties, masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and only",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,then for the first time since he had brooded on the great mystery of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,love did he feel within him a warm movement like that of some newly,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,born life or virtue of the soul itself. The attitude of rapture in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sacred art, the raised and parted hands, the parted lips and eyes as of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"one about to swoon, became for him an image of the soul in prayer,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,humiliated and faint before her Creator.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exaltation and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,did not allow himself to desist from even the least or lowliest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"devotion, striving also by constant mortification to undo the sinful",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril. Each of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his senses was brought under a rigorous discipline. In order to mortify,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"downcast eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women. From time to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"time also he balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled, and made no attempt to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the sharpening of knives on the knifeboard, the gathering of cinders on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the fireshovel and the twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,more difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to bad,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"odours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world, such as those",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of dung or tar, or the odours of his own person among which he had made",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,many curious comparisons and experiments. He found in the end that the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a certain,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stale fishy stink like that of longstanding urine; and whenever it was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,possible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. To mortify the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"taste he practised strict habits at table, observed to the letter all",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the fasts of the church and sought by distraction to divert his mind,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from the savours of different foods. But it was to the mortification of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,touch he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of inventiveness. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"never consciously changed his position in bed, sat in the most",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and pain, kept",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"away from the fire, remained on his knees all through the mass except",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"at the gospels, left part of his neck and face undried so that air",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"might sting them and, whenever he was not saying his beads, carried his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,arms stiffly at his sides like a runner and never in his pockets or,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,clasped behind him.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him however to find,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that at the end of his course of intricate piety and selfrestraint he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections. His,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,prayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,needed an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urged,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him to give outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters, their",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"twitching mouths, closeshut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,comparison. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and scruples. His soul traversed a period of desolation in which the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried up sources. His,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the same dissolving moments of virginal self-surrender as did those,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with fading",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world of fervent love,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the communicant’s prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"soul, telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer with the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: _Inter ubera mea",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,commorabitur._,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind now that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices of the flesh,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"It gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could, by a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"single act of consent, in a moment of thought, undo all that he had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,done. He seemed to feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"his fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost at",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far away from",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of the will or a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sudden ejaculation; and, seeing the silver line of the flood far away",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet, a new thrill of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,power and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yielded,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nor undone all.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grew troubled and wondered whether the grace which he had refused to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lose was not being filched from him little by little. The clear,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,certitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded a vague fear,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that his soul had really fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself that he had prayed to God at every temptation and that the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,God was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations were a proof,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that the devil raged to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,make it fall.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples, some momentary",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"subtle wilfulness in speech or act, he was bidden by his confessor to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,name some sin of his past life before absolution was given him. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,named it with humility and shame and repented of it once more. It,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,humiliated and shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"wholly, however holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he might attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sorrow for his sin? But the surest sign that his confession had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,amendment of his life.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I have amended my life, have I not? he asked himself.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back to the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind, and, as he spoke and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of the other blind,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen stood before him, following for a moment with his eyes the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,waning of the long summer daylight above the roofs or the slow deft,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,movements of the priestly fingers. The priest’s face was in total,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shadow, but the waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grooved temples and the curves of the skull. Stephen followed also with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his ears the accents and intervals of the priest’s voice as he spoke,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, the vacation which had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, the transference of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily with its tale and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on again with respectful,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,questions. He knew that the tale was a prelude and his mind waited for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the sequel. Ever since the message of summons had come for him from the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of the message;,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and, during the long restless time he had sat in the college parlour",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"waiting for the director to come in, his eyes had wandered from one",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sober picture to another around the walls and his mind wandered from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,one guess to another until the meaning of the summons had almost become,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"clear. Then, just as he was wishing that some unforeseen cause might",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"prevent the director from coming, he had heard the handle of the door",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,turning and the swish of a soutane.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The director had begun to speak of the Dominican and Franciscan orders,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and of the friendship between saint Thomas and saint Bonaventure. The,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Capuchin dress, he thought, was rather too....",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen’s face gave back the priest’s indulgent smile and, not being",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative movement with",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his lips.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now among",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the Capuchins themselves of doing away with it and following the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,example of the other Franciscans.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I suppose they would retain it in the cloisters? said Stephen.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right but",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"for the street I really think it would be better to do away with it,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,don’t you?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—It must be troublesome, I imagine.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Belgium I used",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing up,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"about their knees! It was really ridiculous. _Les jupes_, they call",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,them in Belgium.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What do they call them?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—_Les jupes_.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—O!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could not see on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the priest’s shadowed face, its image or spectre only passing rapidly",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,across his mind as the low discreet accent fell upon his ear. He gazed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"calmly before him at the waning sky, glad of the cool of the evening",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and of the faint yellow glow which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cheek.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to his mind a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined the reins by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which horses are driven as slender silken bands and it shocked him to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"feel at Stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness. It had shocked him,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"too, when he had felt for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the brittle texture of a woman’s stocking for, retaining nothing of all",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"state, it was only amid softworded phrases or within rosesoft stuffs",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman moving with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tender life.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But the phrase on the priest’s lips was disingenuous for he knew that a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The phrase had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,spoken lightly with design and he felt that his face was being searched,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever he had heard or read of the craft,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his own,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"experience. His masters, even when they had not attracted him, had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"seemed to him always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,high-spirited prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,bodies briskly with cold water and wore clean cold linen. During all,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in Belvedere he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"received only two pandies and, though these had been dealt him in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"wrong, he knew that he had often escaped punishment. During all those",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,years he had never heard from any of his masters a flippant word: it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was they who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"good life and, when he had fallen into grievous sin, it was they who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had led him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him diffident,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of himself also while he had held his equivocal position in Belvedere.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A constant sense of this had remained with him up to the last year of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his school life. He had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"companions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience; and, even",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"when he doubted some statement of a master, he had never presumed to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,doubt openly. Lately some of their judgements had sounded a little,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as though,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were hearing its,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,language for the last time. One day when some boys had gathered round a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"priest under the shed near the chapel, he had heard the priest say:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never committed a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate mortal sin.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo were not the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,greatest French writer. The priest had answered that Victor Hugo had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,never written half so well when he had turned against the church as he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had written when he was a catholic.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, had not so",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pure a French style as Louis Veuillot.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The tiny flame which the priest’s allusion had kindled upon Stephen’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,colourless sky. But an unresting doubt flew hither and thither before,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his mind. Masked memories passed quickly before him: he recognised,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceive,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,some vital circumstance in them. He saw himself walking about the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,grounds watching the sports in Clongowes and eating slim jim out of his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cricketcap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycle-track in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used in Clongowes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sounded in remote caves of his mind.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the silence of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,parlour when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,different voice.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to you on a",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,very important subject.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Yes, sir.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Have you ever felt that you had a vocation?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the word,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I mean, have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a desire to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,join the order? Think.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his hands,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with himself.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or perhaps",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. Such a boy is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"marked off from his companions by his piety, by the good example he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shows to others. He is looked up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"prefect by his fellow sodalists. And you, Stephen, have been such a boy",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"in this college, prefect of Our Blessed Lady’s sodality. Perhaps you",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,are the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest’s voice,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,made Stephen’s heart quicken in response.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest honour",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No king or emperor on this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,earth has the power of the priest of God. No angel or archangel in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"heaven, no saint, not even the Blessed Virgin herself, has the power of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"a priest of God: the power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from sin, the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"creatures of God the evil spirits that have power over them; the power,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon the altar",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful power, Stephen!",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A flame began to flutter again on Stephen’s cheek as he heard in this,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,proud address an echo of his own proud musings. How often had he seen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power of which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved to muse in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young and silentmannered",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"priest, entering a confessional swiftly, ascending the altarsteps,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing the vague acts of the priesthood",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which pleased him by reason of their semblance of reality and of their,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,distance from it. In that dim life which he had lived through in his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,musings he had assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"various priests. He had bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shaken the thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,swung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar again,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,after having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He shrank,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,should assign to him so clear and final an office. He longed for the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"minor sacred offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"high mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten within its",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"folds or, when the sacrifice had been accomplished, to stand as deacon",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the chant, _Ite",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,missa est._ If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"pictures of the mass in his child’s massbook, in a church without",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar, and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to encounter reality; and it was partly the absence of an appointed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,embrace he longed to give.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He listened in reverent silence now to the priest’s appeal and through,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bidding him approach,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,offering him secret knowledge and secret power. He would know then what,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was the sin of Simon Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from others, from those who were conceived and born children of wrath.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful thoughts and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured into his ears in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,confessional under the shame of a darkened chapel by the lips of women,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and of girls; but rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"imposition of hands, his soul would pass again uncontaminated to the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin would,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink damnation to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,himself not discerning the body of the Lord. He would hold his secret,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"knowledge and secret power, being as sinless as the innocent, and he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,would be a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And let you, Stephen,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first martyr, who is very",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"powerful with God, that God may enlighten your mind. But you must be",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"quite sure, Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,terrible if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once because,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"question, Stephen, because on it may depend the salvation of your",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,eternal soul. But we will pray to God together.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out on to the wide,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,platform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mild,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,evening air. Towards Findlater’s church a quartet of young men were,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"striding along with linked arms, swaying their heads and stepping to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the agile melody of their leader’s concertina. The music passed in an,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"instant, as the first bars of sudden music always did, over the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"fantastic fabrics of his mind, dissolving them painlessly and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolves the sandbuilt turrets of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,children. Smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"face and, seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,detached his hand slowly which had acquiesced faintly in that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,companionship.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his troubled,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,selfcommunion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the threshold of the college. The shadow, then, of the life of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,college passed gravely over his consciousness. It was a grave and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"ordered and passionless life that awaited him, a life without material",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cares. He wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiate,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes came back to him,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames. At once from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,every part of his being unrest began to irradiate. A feverish,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"quickening of his pulses followed, and a din of meaningless words drove",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,smelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in Clongowes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,chill and order of the life repelled him. He saw himself rising in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,trying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the fainting,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sickness of his stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"community of a college. What, then, had become of that deeprooted",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him conceive himself as a being apart in every order?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S. J.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it there followed a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a face. The colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pallid brick red. Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"eyeless and sourfavoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,suffocated anger. Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,jesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Campbell?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in Gardiner,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Street, and wondered vaguely which window would be his if he ever",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"joined the order. Then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder, at",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sanctuary, at the frail hold which so many years of order and obedience",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tale. He would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,priest. His destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The wisdom of the priest’s appeal did not touch him to the quick. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. He had not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. Not to fall was",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"too hard, too hard; and he felt the silent lapse of his soul, as it",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"would be at some instant to come, falling, falling, but not yet fallen,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"still unfallen, but about to fall.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and turned his eyes,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,coldly for an instant towards the faded blue shrine of the Blessed,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Virgin which stood fowl-wise on a pole in the middle of a hamshaped,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"encampment of poor cottages. Then, bending to the left, he followed the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lane which led up to his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the misrule",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and confusion of his father’s house and the stagnation of vegetable,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a short laugh broke",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,gardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hat. A second laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,regretfully plunging his spade in the earth.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He pushed open the latchless door of the porch and passed through the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,naked hallway into the kitchen. A group of his brothers and sisters was,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,sitting round the table. Tea was nearly over and only the last of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,second watered tea remained in the bottoms of the small glass jars and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,jampots which did service for teacups. Discarded crusts and lumps of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"sugared bread, turned brown by the tea which had been poured over them,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lay scattered on the table. Little wells of tea lay here and there on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,pith of a ravaged turnover.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The sad quiet greyblue glow of the dying day came through the window,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and the open door, covering over and allaying quietly a sudden instinct",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of remorse in Stephen’s heart. All that had been denied them had been,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"freely given to him, the eldest; but the quiet glow of evening showed",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,him in their faces no sign of rancour.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He waited for some moments, listening, before he too took up the air",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,with them. He was listening with pain of spirit to the overtone of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,weariness behind their frail fresh innocent voices. Even before they,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,set out on life’s journey they seemed weary already of the way.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He heard the choir of voices in the kitchen echoed and multiplied,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,through an endless reverberation of the choirs of endless generations,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of children and heard in all the echoes an echo also of the recurring,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,note of weariness and pain. All seemed weary of life even before,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,entering upon it. And he remembered that Newman had heard this note,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"also in the broken lines of Virgil, “giving utterance, like the voice",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to be opened to him. It seemed to him that he heard notes of fitful,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Whaley’s time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,He produced four candle-butts from the sidepockets of his soutane and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say...,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lynch halted and said bluntly:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Stop! I won’t listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a yellow,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,drunk with Horan and Goggins.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen went on:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the human sufferer. Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,unites it with the secret cause.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Repeat, said Lynch.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen repeated the definitions slowly.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in London. She",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,At the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the hansom in the shape of a star. A long fine needle of the shivered,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,glass pierced her heart. She died on the instant. The reporter called,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,it a tragic death. It is not. It is remote from terror and pity,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,according to the terms of my definitions.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of it. You see I use",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the word _arrest_. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. The arts",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,arts. The esthetic emotion (I used the general term) is therefore,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told you that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me that when",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dried cowdung.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—O, I did! I did! he cried.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,look from his humbled eyes. The long slender flattened skull beneath,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the long pointed cap brought before Stephen’s mind the image of a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"hooded reptile. The eyes, too, were reptile-like in glint and gaze. Yet",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"at that instant, humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,selfembittered.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all animals. I",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,also am an animal.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—You are, said Lynch.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. The desire",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,because they are not more than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,reflex action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,aware that the fly is about to enter our eye.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Not always, said Lynch critically.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—What is that exactly? asked Lynch.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of part to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or parts,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call beauty; and,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"please remember, though I did eat a cake of cowdung once, that I admire",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,only beauty.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then, blushing slightly, he",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,laid his hand on Lynch’s thick tweed sleeve.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of these",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"things and to try to understand their nature and, having understood it,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,we have come to understand—that is art.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,course of Stephen’s thought.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What is art? What",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is the beauty it expresses?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepyheaded wretch,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the matter for myself.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his temper and began to talk,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,about Wicklow bacon.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat devils of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pigs.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least another,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,cigarette. I don’t care about it. I don’t even care about women. Damn,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a year. You can’t,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,get me one.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the last one,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that remained, saying simply:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Proceed!,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which pleases.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lynch nodded.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I remember that, he said, _Pulcra sunt quæ visa placent._",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—He uses the word _visa,_ said Stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"avenue of apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is clear enough",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,also a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,across the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—No, said Lynch, give me the hypothenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that beauty is",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the splendour of truth. I don’t think that it has a meaning, but the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld by the intellect which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible;,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,satisfying relations of the sensible. The first step in the direction,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to comprehend the act itself of intellection. Aristotle’s entire system,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself of esthetic",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,apprehension. Is that clear?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with another,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you and Aquinas,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,can do?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Let us take woman, said Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That seems to be",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however, two ways out. One",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the maze into a new gaudy lectureroom where MacCann, with one hand on",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"_The Origin of Species_ and the other hand on the new testament, tells",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,yours.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Then MacCann is a sulphuryellow liar, said Lynch energetically.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—To wit? said Lynch.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—This hypothesis, Stephen began.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir Patrick,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Dun’s hospital covering the end of Stephen’s speech with the harsh roar,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,after oath till the dray had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion’s,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,ill-humour had had its vent.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: that, though",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the same object may not seem beautiful to all people, all people who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which satisfy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic apprehension.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"These relations of the sensible, visible to you through one form and to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"me through another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"beauty. Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas for another",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pennyworth of wisdom.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Lynch laughed.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time after time",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your sleeve?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic theory applied",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends, Aquinas",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,will carry me all along the line. When we come to the phenomena of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction I",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,require a new terminology and a new personal experience.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his intellect,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,was exactly a good round friar. But you will tell me about the new,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,personal experience and new terminology some other day. Hurry up and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,finish the first part.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would understand me",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,better than you. He was a poet himself. He wrote a hymn for Maundy,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Thursday. It begins with the words _Pange lingua gloriosi._ They say it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is the highest glory of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,hymn. I like it; but there is no hymn that can be put beside that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"_Three things are needed for beauty, wholeness, harmony and radiance._",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Do these correspond to the phases of apprehension? Are you following?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excrementitious",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,his head.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Look at that basket, he said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I see it, said Lynch.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of all",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,about the object to be apprehended. An esthetic image is presented to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"us either in space or in time. What is audible is presented in time,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"what is visible is presented in space. But temporal or spatial, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,esthetic image is first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,selfcontained upon the immeasurable background of space or time which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,is not it. You apprehended it as _one_ thing. You see it as one whole.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,You apprehend its wholeness. That is _integritas._,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Bull’s eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its formal",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,apprehension. Having first felt that it is _one_ thing you feel now,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that it is a _thing_. You apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,harmonious. That is _consonantia_.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Bull’s eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is _claritas_,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and you win the cigar.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. Aquinas",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,but the symbol. I thought he might mean that _claritas_ is the artistic,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,I understand it so. When you have apprehended that basket as one thing,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic _quidditas_,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the _whatness_ of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,very like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley’s, called",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the enchantment of the heart.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider sense",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary tradition.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of beauty in the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first place,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"by the art itself and by the form of that art. The image, it is clear,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,mind or senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; the epical,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"form, the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form wherein he presents",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,his image in immediate relation to others.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we began the famous",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,discussion.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written down",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,answers to them I found the theory of esthetic which I am trying to,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,explain. Here are some questions I set myself: _Is a chair finely made,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,tragic or comic? Is the portrait of Mona Lisa good if I desire to see,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"it? Is the bust of Sir Philip Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic. If",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"not, why not?_",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—_If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood,_ Stephen continued,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"_make there an image of a cow, is that image a work of art? If not, why",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,not?_,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That’s a lovely one, said Lynch, laughing again. That has the true",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,scholastic stink.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the forms I spoke",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature, the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,emotion. The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The personality of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,the persons and the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"easily in that old English ballad _Turpin Hero,_ which begins in the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,first person and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist, at first a cry",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic, like",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"that of material creation, is accomplished. The artist, like the God of",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about beauty and the",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,country.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage beside,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the library. Cranly, leaning against a pillar, was picking his teeth",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with a sharpened match, listening to some companions. Some girls stood",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,near the entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Your beloved is here.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,towards her from time to time. She too stood silently among her,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with conscious",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. Lynch was right. His",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,Lapide which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He struck the flags again and tittered while his head trembled with a,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"O’Keeffe were speaking in Irish and did not answer him. Then, turning",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Give us that stick here, Cranly said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen’s hand and sprang down,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"dusk like a wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. Cranly’s heavy",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,back into Stephen’s hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,from _Siegfried_ whistled softly followed them from the steps of the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple’s hotel he stood to wait,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,stared angrily back at the softly lit drawingroom of the hotel in which,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed in,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in highpitched,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them,",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes, under trees",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs. A woman had,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering him",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for Davin had the mild",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,eyes of one who could be secret. But him no woman’s eyes had wooed.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly’s voice said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Let us eke go.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That blithering idiot, Temple! I swear to Moses, do you know, that",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,I’ll be the death of that fellow one time.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinking,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,of her greeting to him under the porch.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they had gone on,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,so for some time Stephen said:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—With my mother.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Yes, Stephen answered.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,After a pause Cranly asked:,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter duty.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—And will you?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I will not, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Why not? Cranly said.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I will not serve, answered Stephen.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Cranly pressed Stephen’s arm, saying:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Stephen’s face",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"with moved and friendly eyes, said:",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"closer, one to the other.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,"—I do not, Stephen said.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,—Do you disbelieve then?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered.",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"—Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they overcome",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your doubts on that point too",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,strong?,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

4217,of chewed fig.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted.,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
4217,"Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and",A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
