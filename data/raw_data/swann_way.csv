7178,OVERTURE,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out",Swann's Way
7178,"my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to",Swann's Way
7178,"say ""I'm going to sleep."" And half an hour later the thought that it was",Swann's Way
7178,time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book,Swann's Way
7178,"which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I",Swann's Way
7178,"had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just",Swann's Way
7178,"been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own,",Swann's Way
7178,until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book:,Swann's Way
7178,"a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This",Swann's Way
7178,impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not,Swann's Way
7178,"disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them",Swann's Way
7178,from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then,Swann's Way
7178,"it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former",Swann's Way
7178,existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would,Swann's Way
7178,"separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form",Swann's Way
7178,part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I,Swann's Way
7178,"would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and",Swann's Way
7178,"restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to",Swann's Way
7178,"which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark",Swann's Way
7178,indeed.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I would ask myself what o'clock it could be; I could hear the whistling,Swann's Way
7178,"of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the",Swann's Way
7178,"distance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective",Swann's Way
7178,the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying,Swann's Way
7178,towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for,Swann's Way
7178,ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange,Swann's Way
7178,"place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to",Swann's Way
7178,farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his,Swann's Way
7178,ears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of,Swann's Way
7178,being once again at home.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my,Swann's Way
7178,"pillow, as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would",Swann's Way
7178,strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an,Swann's Way
7178,"invalid, who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a",Swann's Way
7178,"strange hotel, awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief",Swann's Way
7178,"a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys!",Swann's Way
7178,"it is morning. The servants will be about in a minute: he can ring,",Swann's Way
7178,and some one will come to look after him. The thought of being made,Swann's Way
7178,comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain. He is certain he,Swann's Way
7178,"heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light",Swann's Way
7178,beneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned,Swann's Way
7178,"out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night",Swann's Way
7178,in agony with no one to bring him any help.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches",Swann's Way
7178,"only, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or",Swann's Way
7178,"to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness,",Swann's Way
7178,"to savour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay",Swann's Way
7178,"heavy upon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I",Swann's Way
7178,formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very,Swann's Way
7178,"soon return to share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned",Swann's Way
7178,"without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever",Swann's Way
7178,"outgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors,",Swann's Way
7178,"such as that old terror of my great-uncle's pulling my curls, which was",Swann's Way
7178,effectually dispelled on the day--the dawn of a new era to me--on which,Swann's Way
7178,they were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event,Swann's Way
7178,during my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in,Swann's Way
7178,"making myself wake up to escape my great-uncle's fingers; still, as a",Swann's Way
7178,"measure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow",Swann's Way
7178,before returning to the world of dreams.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman",Swann's Way
7178,"would come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some",Swann's Way
7178,strain in the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was,Swann's Way
7178,"on the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that",Swann's Way
7178,"gratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating",Swann's Way
7178,"hers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest",Swann's Way
7178,of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose,Swann's Way
7178,company I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her,Swann's Way
7178,"kiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes",Swann's Way
7178,"happen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking",Swann's Way
7178,"hours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like",Swann's Way
7178,people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city,Swann's Way
7178,"that they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste",Swann's Way
7178,"in reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory",Swann's Way
7178,"of her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my",Swann's Way
7178,dream.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the",Swann's Way
7178,"hours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host.",Swann's Way
7178,"Instinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant",Swann's Way
7178,reads off his own position on the earth's surface and the amount of time,Swann's Way
7178,that has elapsed during his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt,Swann's Way
7178,"to grow confused, and to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning,",Swann's Way
7178,"after a night of insomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading,",Swann's Way
7178,in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to,Swann's Way
7178,"sleep, he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back",Swann's Way
7178,"in its course, and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the",Swann's Way
7178,"time, but will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he",Swann's Way
7178,"gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair,",Swann's Way
7178,"say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit,",Swann's Way
7178,"the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space,",Swann's Way
7178,and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep,Swann's Way
7178,months earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough,Swann's Way
7178,"if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my",Swann's Way
7178,consciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had,Swann's Way
7178,"gone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was,",Swann's Way
7178,I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary,Swann's Way
7178,"sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an",Swann's Way
7178,animal's consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the,Swann's Way
7178,"cave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I",Swann's Way
7178,"was, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very",Swann's Way
7178,"possibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up",Swann's Way
7178,"out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped",Swann's Way
7178,by myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of,Swann's Way
7178,"civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps,",Swann's Way
7178,"followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by",Swann's Way
7178,degrees the component parts of my ego.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon,Swann's Way
7178,"them by our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else,",Swann's Way
7178,and by the immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened,Swann's Way
7178,"that when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful",Swann's Way
7178,"attempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me",Swann's Way
7178,"through the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy",Swann's Way
7178,"with sleep to move, would make an effort to construe the form which its",Swann's Way
7178,"tiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so as to induce",Swann's Way
7178,"from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together",Swann's Way
7178,"and to give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory,",Swann's Way
7178,"the composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it",Swann's Way
7178,a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept;,Swann's Way
7178,"while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the shape",Swann's Way
7178,"of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the",Swann's Way
7178,"darkness. And even before my brain, lingering in consideration of when",Swann's Way
7178,"things had happened and of what they had looked like, had collected",Swann's Way
7178,"sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room, it, my body,",Swann's Way
7178,"would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like, where",Swann's Way
7178,"the doors were, how daylight came in at the windows, whether there was a",Swann's Way
7178,"passage outside, what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep, and had",Swann's Way
7178,"found there when I awoke. The stiffened side underneath my body would,",Swann's Way
7178,"for instance, in trying to fix its position, imagine itself to be lying,",Swann's Way
7178,"face to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy; and at once I would say to",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, ""Why, I must have gone to sleep after all, and Mamma never came",Swann's Way
7178,"to say good night!"" for I was in the country with my grandfather, who",Swann's Way
7178,"died years ago; and my body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally",Swann's Way
7178,preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have,Swann's Way
7178,"forgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the",Swann's Way
7178,"night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn and hung",Swann's Way
7178,"by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble in my",Swann's Way
7178,"bedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt's house, in those far distant days",Swann's Way
7178,"which, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly",Swann's Way
7178,"penned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly",Swann's Way
7178,awake.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in,Swann's Way
7178,another direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup's house in the,Swann's Way
7178,"country; good heavens, it must be ten o'clock, they will have finished",Swann's Way
7178,"dinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always",Swann's Way
7178,"take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before",Swann's Way
7178,dressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would",Swann's Way
7178,still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the,Swann's Way
7178,panes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence,Swann's Way
7178,"at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from",Swann's Way
7178,"visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in",Swann's Way
7178,"the sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return",Swann's Way
7178,"from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary",Swann's Way
7178,beacon in the night.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than,Swann's Way
7178,"a few seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to",Swann's Way
7178,"where I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that",Swann's Way
7178,"uncertainty was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running,",Swann's Way
7178,we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon,Swann's Way
7178,a bioscope. But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in,Swann's Way
7178,"which I had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them",Swann's Way
7178,"all in the long course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on",Swann's Way
7178,"going to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the",Swann's Way
7178,"most diverse materials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets,",Swann's Way
7178,"a piece of a shawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper,",Swann's Way
7178,"all of which things I would contrive, with the infinite patience of",Swann's Way
7178,"birds building their nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in",Swann's Way
7178,"a keen frost, I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the",Swann's Way
7178,outer world (like the sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark,Swann's Way
7178,"tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth), and where, the fire",Swann's Way
7178,"keeping in all night, I would sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great",Swann's Way
7178,"cloak of snug and savoury air, shot with the glow of the logs which",Swann's Way
7178,"would break out again in flame: in a sort of alcove without walls, a",Swann's Way
7178,"cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat",Swann's Way
7178,whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature,Swann's Way
7178,"as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face, from",Swann's Way
7178,"the corners of the room, or from parts near the window or far from the",Swann's Way
7178,"fireplace which had therefore remained cold--or rooms in summer, where",Swann's Way
7178,"I would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening, where the",Swann's Way
7178,moonlight striking upon the half-opened shutters would throw down to the,Swann's Way
7178,"foot of my bed its enchanted ladder; where I would fall asleep, as it",Swann's Way
7178,"might be in the open air, like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised",Swann's Way
7178,"in the focus of a sunbeam--or sometimes the Louis XVI room, so cheerful",Swann's Way
7178,"that I could never feel really unhappy, even on my first night in it:",Swann's Way
7178,that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling,Swann's Way
7178,"would part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where the bed was and",Swann's Way
7178,to keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with the high,Swann's Way
7178,"ceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys,",Swann's Way
7178,"and partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment my mind",Swann's Way
7178,"was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses, convinced of",Swann's Way
7178,the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of,Swann's Way
7178,a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not,Swann's Way
7178,"there; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet, which",Swann's Way
7178,"stood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site I had not",Swann's Way
7178,looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of,Swann's Way
7178,"vision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on end",Swann's Way
7178,"to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the",Swann's Way
7178,"exact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous",Swann's Way
7178,"funnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched",Swann's Way
7178,"out in bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils",Swann's Way
7178,"sniffing uneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the",Swann's Way
7178,"colour of the curtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression",Swann's Way
7178,"of pity to the cruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even",Swann's Way
7178,"completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly",Swann's Way
7178,reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but,Swann's Way
7178,unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end,Swann's Way
7178,"with her provisional arrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is",Swann's Way
7178,"fortunate in discovering, for without the help of custom it would never",Swann's Way
7178,"contrive, by its own efforts, to make any room seem habitable.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Certainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last,Swann's Way
7178,time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding,Swann's Way
7178,"objects stand still, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom,",Swann's Way
7178,"and had fixed, approximately in their right places in the uncertain",Swann's Way
7178,"light, my chest of drawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window",Swann's Way
7178,"overlooking the street, and both the doors. But it was no good my",Swann's Way
7178,"knowing that I was not in any of those houses of which, in the stupid",Swann's Way
7178,"moment of waking, if I had not caught sight exactly, I could still",Swann's Way
7178,believe in their possible presence; for memory was now set in motion; as,Swann's Way
7178,"a rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once, but used to spend",Swann's Way
7178,the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray with my great-aunt, at Balbec, Paris, Doncières, Venice, and the",Swann's Way
7178,"rest; remembering again all the places and people that I had known, what",Swann's Way
7178,"I had actually seen of them, and what others had told me.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should",Swann's Way
7178,"have to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my",Swann's Way
7178,"mother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my",Swann's Way
7178,melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy,Swann's Way
7178,"idea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally",Swann's Way
7178,"wretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while",Swann's Way
7178,we waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders,Swann's Way
7178,and glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness,Swann's Way
7178,"of my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many",Swann's Way
7178,"colours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory",Swann's Way
7178,"window. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of",Swann's Way
7178,"lighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary",Swann's Way
7178,"impression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself,",Swann's Way
7178,"but for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite",Swann's Way
7178,"endurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place",Swann's Way
7178,"where I had just arrived, by train, for the first time.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Riding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design,",Swann's Way
7178,issued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the,Swann's Way
7178,"slope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the",Swann's Way
7178,castle of poor Geneviève de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by,Swann's Way
7178,a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the,Swann's Way
7178,transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through,Swann's Way
7178,"a slot in the lantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front",Swann's Way
7178,"of it stretched a moor on which Geneviève stood, lost in contemplation,",Swann's Way
7178,"wearing a blue girdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could",Swann's Way
7178,"tell their colour without waiting to see them, for before the slides",Swann's Way
7178,made their appearance the old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given,Swann's Way
7178,me an unmistakable clue. Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to,Swann's Way
7178,"the little speech read aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly",Swann's Way
7178,"to understand, for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid",Swann's Way
7178,"of a degree of majesty, so as to conform to the indications given in the",Swann's Way
7178,text; then he rode away at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest,Swann's Way
7178,his slow progress. If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish,Swann's Way
7178,"Golo's horse advancing across the window-curtains, swelling out with",Swann's Way
7178,"their curves and diving into their folds. The body of Golo himself,",Swann's Way
7178,"being of the same supernatural substance as his steed's, overcame all",Swann's Way
7178,material obstacles--everything that seemed to bar his way--by taking,Swann's Way
7178,each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself: the,Swann's Way
7178,"door-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at once, would",Swann's Way
7178,"float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing its",Swann's Way
7178,"nobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such a",Swann's Way
7178,transubstantiation.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed",Swann's Way
7178,around me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express,Swann's Way
7178,the discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into,Swann's Way
7178,a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until,Swann's Way
7178,I thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect,Swann's Way
7178,"of custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very",Swann's Way
7178,"melancholy things. The door-handle of my room, which was different to",Swann's Way
7178,"me from all the other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to",Swann's Way
7178,"open of its own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious",Swann's Way
7178,"had its manipulation become; lo and behold, it was now an astral body",Swann's Way
7178,for Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the,Swann's Way
7178,"dining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard",Swann's Way
7178,"but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef, shed the",Swann's Way
7178,same light as on every other evening; and I would fall into the arms of,Swann's Way
7178,"my mother, whom the misfortunes of Geneviève de Brabant had made all the",Swann's Way
7178,"dearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than",Swann's Way
7178,ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed",Swann's Way
7178,"talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little",Swann's Way
7178,parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my,Swann's Way
7178,"grandmother, who held that ""It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the",Swann's Way
7178,"country,"" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the",Swann's Way
7178,"very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of letting me stay out of doors. ""That is not the way to make",Swann's Way
7178,"him strong and active,"" she would say sadly, ""especially this little",Swann's Way
7178,"man, who needs all the strength and character that he can get."" My",Swann's Way
7178,"father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an",Swann's Way
7178,"interest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not",Swann's Way
7178,"to disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard,",Swann's Way
7178,not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my,Swann's Way
7178,"grandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in",Swann's Way
7178,torrents and Françoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker,Swann's Way
7178,"armchairs, so that they should not get soaked--you would see my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing",Swann's Way
7178,back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to,Swann's Way
7178,"imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, ""At",Swann's Way
7178,"last one can breathe!"" and would run up and down the soaking paths--too",Swann's Way
7178,"straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any",Swann's Way
7178,"feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking",Swann's Way
7178,"all morning if the weather were going to improve--with her keen, jerky",Swann's Way
7178,little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by,Swann's Way
7178,"the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of",Swann's Way
7178,"my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for",Swann's Way
7178,that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the,Swann's Way
7178,spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which,Swann's Way
7178,always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh,Swann's Way
7178,despair.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,When these walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner there was,Swann's Way
7178,one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if,Swann's Way
7178,"(at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her,",Swann's Way
7178,"moth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs",Swann's Way
7178,were set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her:,Swann's Way
7178,"""Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!"" For,",Swann's Way
7178,simply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my,Swann's Way
7178,"father's family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to",Swann's Way
7178,"make my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops.",Swann's Way
7178,My poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to,Swann's Way
7178,taste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops,Swann's Way
7178,"all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still",Swann's Way
7178,"smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards",Swann's Way
7178,"others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own",Swann's Way
7178,"troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those",Swann's Way
7178,"seen on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save",Swann's Way
7178,"for herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow,Swann's Way
7178,upon them passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my,Swann's Way
7178,"great-aunt, the sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in",Swann's Way
7178,"her weakness conquered before she began, but still making the futile",Swann's Way
7178,endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur-glass--all these,Swann's Way
7178,"were things of the sort to which, in later years, one can grow so well",Swann's Way
7178,"accustomed as to smile at them, to take the tormentor's side with a.",Swann's Way
7178,"happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not,",Swann's Way
7178,"really, tormenting; but in those days they filled me with such horror",Swann's Way
7178,"that I longed to strike my great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her",Swann's Way
7178,"""Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!"" in my",Swann's Way
7178,"cowardice I became at once a man, and did what all we grown men do when",Swann's Way
7178,face to face with suffering and injustice; I preferred not to see them;,Swann's Way
7178,I ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room,Swann's Way
7178,"beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof, which smelt of orris-root,",Swann's Way
7178,and was scented also by a wild currant-bush which had climbed up between,Swann's Way
7178,the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through,Swann's Way
7178,"the half-opened window. Intended for a more special and a baser use,",Swann's Way
7178,"this room, from which, in the daytime, I could see as far as the keep of",Swann's Way
7178,"Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time my place of refuge, doubtless",Swann's Way
7178,"because it was the only room whose door Ï was allowed to lock, whenever",Swann's Way
7178,my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude; reading or,Swann's Way
7178,"dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of desire. Alas! I little knew",Swann's Way
7178,"that my own lack of will-power, my delicate health, and the consequent",Swann's Way
7178,uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother's,Swann's Way
7178,"mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband, during those",Swann's Way
7178,"endless perambulations, afternoon and evening, in which we used to see",Swann's Way
7178,"passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the heavens, her handsome",Swann's Way
7178,"face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with age had acquired",Swann's Way
7178,"almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn, covered, if she were",Swann's Way
7178,"walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon them either the",Swann's Way
7178,cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an,Swann's Way
7178,involuntary tear.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma,Swann's Way
7178,would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted,Swann's Way
7178,for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in,Swann's Way
7178,"which I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her",Swann's Way
7178,"garden dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited",Swann's Way
7178,"straw, rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment",Swann's Way
7178,of the keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached,Swann's Way
7178,"the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as",Swann's Way
7178,to prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have,Swann's Way
7178,"appeared. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I",Swann's Way
7178,"longed to call her back, to say to her ""Kiss me just once again,"" but",Swann's Way
7178,"I knew that then she would at once look displeased, for the concession",Swann's Way
7178,which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with,Swann's Way
7178,"this kiss of peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies",Swann's Way
7178,"absurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the",Swann's Way
7178,"need, the custom of having her there at all, which was a very different",Swann's Way
7178,thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional,Swann's Way
7178,kiss when she was already crossing the threshold. And to see her look,Swann's Way
7178,displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a,Swann's Way
7178,"moment before, when she bent her loving face down over my bed, and held",Swann's Way
7178,"it out to me like a Host, for an act of Communion in which my lips might",Swann's Way
7178,"drink deeply the sense of her real presence, and with it the power to",Swann's Way
7178,sleep. But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in,Swann's Way
7178,my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests,Swann's Way
7178,"to dinner, and therefore she did not come at all. Our 'guests'",Swann's Way
7178,"were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few passing",Swann's Way
7178,"strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the house at",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently since",Swann's Way
7178,"his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his wife)",Swann's Way
7178,"and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we sat",Swann's Way
7178,in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron,Swann's Way
7178,"table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and",Swann's Way
7178,noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its,Swann's Way
7178,"ferruginous, interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who",Swann's Way
7178,"had put it out of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double",Swann's Way
7178,"peal--timid, oval, gilded--of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once",Swann's Way
7178,"exclaim ""A visitor! Who in the world can it be?"" but they knew quite",Swann's Way
7178,"well that it could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud",Swann's Way
7178,"voice, to set an example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound",Swann's Way
7178,"natural, would tell the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be",Swann's Way
7178,"more unpleasant for a stranger coming in, who would be led to think that",Swann's Way
7178,people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear; and,Swann's Way
7178,"then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find",Swann's Way
7178,"an excuse for an additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise",Swann's Way
7178,"to remove surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or",Swann's Way
7178,"two, so as to make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother",Swann's Way
7178,"might run her hand through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed",Swann's Way
7178,"it down, to make it stick out properly round his head.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from",Swann's Way
7178,my grandmother's lips when she brought us back her report of the,Swann's Way
7178,"enemy, as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of",Swann's Way
7178,"possible invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"can hear Swann's voice."" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his",Swann's Way
7178,"voice, for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose",Swann's Way
7178,"and green eyes, under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red",Swann's Way
7178,"hair, dressed in the Bressant style, because in the garden we used as",Swann's Way
7178,"little light as possible, so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would",Swann's Way
7178,"slip away as though not going for anything in particular, to tell them",Swann's Way
7178,"to bring out the syrups; for my grandmother made a great point, thinking",Swann's Way
7178,it 'nicer' of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the,Swann's Way
7178,"ordinary, which we kept for visitors only. Although a far younger man,",Swann's Way
7178,"M. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather, who had been an",Swann's Way
7178,"intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's father, an excellent but an",Swann's Way
7178,"eccentric man in whom the least little thing would, it seemed, often",Swann's Way
7178,check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts.,Swann's Way
7178,Several times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell,Swann's Way
7178,"at table the story, which never varied, of the behaviour of M. Swann the",Swann's Way
7178,"elder upon the death of his wife, by whose bedside he had watched",Swann's Way
7178,"day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time,",Swann's Way
7178,hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on the outskirts of,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping profusely, out",Swann's Way
7178,"of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when the body was",Swann's Way
7178,"laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park, where there was",Swann's Way
7178,a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm,Swann's Way
7178,"and cried, ""Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be walking",Swann's Way
7178,"here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty they are,",Swann's Way
7178,"all these trees--my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you have never",Swann's Way
7178,congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you feel this,Swann's Way
7178,"little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive all the",Swann's Way
7178,"same, my dear Amédée!"" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife",Swann's Way
7178,"returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire",Swann's Way
7178,"into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried",Swann's Way
7178,"away by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which",Swann's Way
7178,he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his,Swann's Way
7178,"mind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,and wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of,Swann's Way
7178,"his wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for",Swann's Way
7178,"which he survived her, ""It's a funny thing, now; I very often think",Swann's Way
7178,"of my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time.""",Swann's Way
7178,"""Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,"" became one of my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandfather's favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of",Swann's Way
7178,things. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann's had been,Swann's Way
7178,"a monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to",Swann's Way
7178,"pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not",Swann's Way
7178,"gone on to exclaim, ""But, after all, he had a heart of gold.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For many years, albeit--and especially before his marriage--M. Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"the younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and",Swann's Way
7178,grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the,Swann's Way
7178,"kind of society which his family had frequented, or that, under the",Swann's Way
7178,"sort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were",Swann's Way
7178,harbouring--with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers,Swann's Way
7178,who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know,Swann's Way
7178,"it--one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club, a particular friend",Swann's Way
7178,"of the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales, and one of the",Swann's Way
7178,men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg,Swann's Way
7178,Saint-Germain.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in,Swann's Way
7178,"the world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and",Swann's Way
7178,"discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days",Swann's Way
7178,"took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist",Swann's Way
7178,"of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself",Swann's Way
7178,"called to that station in life which his parents already occupied,",Swann's Way
7178,"and nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good'",Swann's Way
7178,"marriage, could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior",Swann's Way
7178,"caste. M. Swann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so 'young",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann' found himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as",Swann's Way
7178,"in a list of taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income.",Swann's Way
7178,"We knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew",Swann's Way
7178,"his own associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.'",Swann's Way
7178,"If he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on",Swann's Way
7178,"whom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes",Swann's Way
7178,"all the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an",Swann's Way
7178,"orphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been",Swann's Way
7178,ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew,Swann's Way
7178,"were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had",Swann's Way
7178,he met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a,Swann's Way
7178,thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar,Swann's Way
7178,"to himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in",Swann's Way
7178,"his father's position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than",Swann's Way
7178,"theirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had",Swann's Way
7178,"a craze for 'antiques' and pictures, he now lived and piled up his",Swann's Way
7178,"collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit,",Swann's Way
7178,"but which stood on the Quai d'Orléans, a neighbourhood in which my",Swann's Way
7178,"great-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. ""Are you really",Swann's Way
7178,"a connoisseur, now?"" she would say to him; ""I ask for your own sake, as",Swann's Way
7178,"you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers,"" for",Swann's Way
7178,"she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no",Swann's Way
7178,"great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would",Swann's Way
7178,"avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when",Swann's Way
7178,"he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but",Swann's Way
7178,even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art. When,Swann's Way
7178,"challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his admiration for",Swann's Way
7178,"some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and would then",Swann's Way
7178,make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other about the,Swann's Way
7178,"gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it had been",Swann's Way
7178,painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse,Swann's Way
7178,us by telling us the story of his latest adventure--and he would have,Swann's Way
7178,a fresh story for us on every occasion--with some one whom we ourselves,Swann's Way
7178,"knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman. These",Swann's Way
7178,"stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could",Swann's Way
7178,never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"invariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he",Swann's Way
7178,"shewed in telling us of them. ""It is easy to see that you are a regular",Swann's Way
7178,"'character,' M. Swann!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a,Swann's Way
7178,"trifle 'common,' she would always take care to remark to strangers, when",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have",Swann's Way
7178,"lived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l'Opéra, and that",Swann's Way
7178,he was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million,Swann's Way
7178,"francs, but that it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought",Swann's Way
7178,"was bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann",Swann's Way
7178,called on New Year's Day bringing her a little packet of _marrons,Swann's Way
7178,"glacés_, she never failed, if there were strangers in the room, to say",Swann's Way
7178,"to him: ""Well, M. Swann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded",Swann's Way
7178,"Vaults, so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to",Swann's Way
7178,"Lyons?"" and she would peep out of the corner of her eye, over her",Swann's Way
7178,"glasses, at the other visitors.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his",Swann's Way
7178,"capacity as the son of old M. Swann, was 'fully qualified' to be",Swann's Way
7178,"received by any of the 'upper middle class,' the most respected",Swann's Way
7178,barristers and solicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle,Swann's Way
7178,"inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another",Swann's Way
7178,almost secret existence of a wholly different kind: that when he left,Swann's Way
7178,"our house in Paris, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no",Swann's Way
7178,"sooner have turned the corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and",Swann's Way
7178,be off to some drawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate,Swann's Way
7178,of stockbrokers had ever set eyes--that would have seemed to my aunt,Swann's Way
7178,"as extraordinary as, to a woman of wider reading, the thought of being",Swann's Way
7178,"herself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus, of knowing that he would,",Swann's Way
7178,"when he had finished his conversation with her, plunge deep into the",Swann's Way
7178,"realms of Thetis, into an empire veiled from mortal eyes, in which",Swann's Way
7178,Virgil depicts him as being received with open arms; or--to be content,Swann's Way
7178,"with an image more likely to have occurred to her, for she had seen it",Swann's Way
7178,painted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray--as the thought,Swann's Way
7178,"of having had to dinner Ali Baba, who, as soon as he found himself alone",Swann's Way
7178,"and unobserved, would make his way into the cave, resplendent with its",Swann's Way
7178,unsuspected treasures.,Swann's Way

7178,"One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged",Swann's Way

7178,"us that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining ""with a",Swann's Way
7178,"princess."" ""A pretty sort of princess,"" drawled my aunt; ""I know",Swann's Way
7178,"them,"" and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her",Swann's Way
7178,"knitting, serenely ironical.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was",Swann's Way
7178,"of the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she",Swann's Way
7178,thought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in,Swann's Way
7178,"summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden,",Swann's Way
7178,and that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some,Swann's Way
7178,photographs of old masters for me.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted",Swann's Way
7178,a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of,Swann's Way
7178,"our big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not",Swann's Way
7178,seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who,Swann's Way
7178,might be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned,Swann's Way
7178,"upon the Princes of the House of France, ""Gentlemen, you and I will",Swann's Way
7178,"never know, will we, and don't want to, do we?"" my great-aunt would",Swann's Way
7178,"say tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his",Swann's Way
7178,pocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on,Swann's Way
7178,"evenings when my grandmother's sister sang; manipulating this creature,",Swann's Way
7178,"so rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough",Swann's Way
7178,simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no,Swann's Way
7178,more carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was,Swann's Way
7178,"a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from,",Swann's Way
7178,"the Swann created in my great-aunt's mind when, of an evening, in our",Swann's Way
7178,"little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the",Swann's Way
7178,"gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever",Swann's Way
7178,"heard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which",Swann's Way
7178,"began to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background",Swann's Way
7178,"of shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice.",Swann's Way
7178,"But then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none",Swann's Way
7178,"of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for",Swann's Way
7178,"everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or",Swann's Way
7178,the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts,Swann's Way
7178,"of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as ""seeing some",Swann's Way
7178,"one we know"" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the",Swann's Way
7178,physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have,Swann's Way
7178,"already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we",Swann's Way
7178,compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In,Swann's Way
7178,"the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to",Swann's Way
7178,"follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in",Swann's Way
7178,the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent,Swann's Way
7178,"envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our",Swann's Way
7178,"own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no",Swann's Way
7178,"doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family",Swann's Way
7178,"had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his",Swann's Way
7178,"daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other",Swann's Way
7178,"people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and",Swann's Way
7178,stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but,Swann's Way
7178,they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had,Swann's Way
7178,"been evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant",Swann's Way
7178,"in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not",Swann's Way
7178,"unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together",Swann's Way
7178,"after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during",Swann's Way
7178,our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so,Swann's Way
7178,"well lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his",Swann's Way
7178,"family, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete",Swann's Way
7178,and living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving,Swann's Way
7178,"some one I know for another quite different person when, going back in",Swann's Way
7178,"memory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately",Swann's Way
7178,to this early Swann--this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the,Swann's Way
7178,"charming mistakes of my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like",Swann's Way
7178,"his successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as",Swann's Way
7178,though one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits,Swann's Way
7178,"of any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak)",Swann's Way
7178,"tonality--this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent",Swann's Way
7178,"of the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of",Swann's Way
7178,tarragon.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a",Swann's Way
7178,"lady whom she had known at the Sacré Coeur (and with whom, because of",Swann's Way
7178,"our caste theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in",Swann's Way
7178,"spite of several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the",Swann's Way
7178,"famous house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my",Swann's Way
7178,"nephews, the des Laumes.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,",Swann's Way
7178,"which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had",Swann's Way
7178,advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his,Swann's Way
7178,"daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had",Swann's Way
7178,"gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the",Swann's Way
7178,staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the,Swann's Way
7178,"girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man,",Swann's Way
7178,the finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing,Swann's Way
7178,wholly independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some,Swann's Way
7178,"answer the tailor had made, saying to Mamma:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Sévigné would not have said it better!"" and, by way of contrast, of a",Swann's Way
7178,nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""My dear, he is so common!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him",Swann's Way
7178,"in my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It",Swann's Way
7178,"appeared that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we",Swann's Way
7178,owed to Mme. de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to,Swann's Way
7178,"do nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that",Swann's Way
7178,she had failed in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and,Swann's Way
7178,"in allowing members of her family to associate with him. ""How should",Swann's Way
7178,"she know Swann? A lady who, you always made out, was related to Marshal",Swann's Way
7178,"MacMahon!"" This view of Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my",Swann's Way
7178,family seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of,Swann's Way
7178,"the worst class, you might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him",Swann's Way
7178,"justice, he never attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come",Swann's Way
7178,"to us alone, though he came more and more seldom; but from whom they",Swann's Way
7178,"thought they could establish, on the assumption that he had found her",Swann's Way
7178,"there, the circle, unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was,Swann's Way
7178,one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the,Swann's Way
7178,"Duc de X----, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent",Swann's Way
7178,statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious,Swann's Way
7178,to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental,Swann's Way
7178,"share in the private lives of men like Mole, the Duc Pasquier, or the",Swann's Way
7178,Duc de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with,Swann's Way
7178,"people who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this",Swann's Way
7178,piece of news in a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose,Swann's Way
7178,"his associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred,",Swann's Way
7178,"outside his 'proper station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her",Swann's Way
7178,eyes. It seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the,Swann's Way
7178,fruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which,Swann's Way
7178,"prudent parents cultivate and store up for their children's benefit, for",Swann's Way
7178,my great-aunt had actually ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we,Swann's Way
7178,had known because he had married a 'Highness' and had thereby stepped,Swann's Way
7178,down--in her eyes--from the respectable position of a lawyer's son to,Swann's Way
7178,"that of those adventurers, upstart footmen or stable-boys mostly,",Swann's Way
7178,to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours. She,Swann's Way
7178,"objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of questioning Swann, when",Swann's Way
7178,"next he came to dine with us, about these people whose friendship with",Swann's Way
7178,"him we had discovered. On the other hand, my grandmother's two sisters,",Swann's Way
7178,elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her,Swann's Way
7178,"intelligence, declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their",Swann's Way
7178,brother-in-law could find in talking about such trifles. They were,Swann's Way
7178,"ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were incapable of taking",Swann's Way
7178,the least interest in what might be called the 'pinchbeck' things of,Swann's Way
7178,"life, even when they had an historic value, or, generally speaking, in",Swann's Way
7178,anything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically,Swann's Way
7178,precious. So complete was their negation of interest in anything which,Swann's Way
7178,seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their,Swann's Way
7178,sense of hearing--which had gradually come to understand its own,Swann's Way
7178,"futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table, became",Swann's Way
7178,"frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able to",Swann's Way
7178,guide it back to the topic dear to themselves--would leave its receptive,Swann's Way
7178,"channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually becoming",Swann's Way
7178,atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of,Swann's Way
7178,"the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm signals",Swann's Way
7178,as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as by,Swann's Way
7178,"beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them",Swann's Way
7178,"at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent",Swann's Way
7178,methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their,Swann's Way
7178,"everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or",Swann's Way
7178,because they think the whole world a trifle mad.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine",Swann's Way
7178,"with us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti,",Swann's Way
7178,"my great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to",Swann's Way
7178,the name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the,Swann's Way
7178,"words, ""from the collection of M. Charles Swann,"" asked: ""Did you see",Swann's Way
7178,"that Swann is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But I have always told you,"" said my grandmother, ""that he had plenty",Swann's Way
7178,"of taste.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You would, of course,"" retorted my great-aunt, ""say anything just to",Swann's Way
7178,"seem different from _us_."" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed",Swann's Way
7178,"with her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion",Swann's Way
7178,"which the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us",Swann's Way
7178,"a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she",Swann's Way
7178,hoped to force us into solidarity with her own.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire,Swann's Way
7178,"to mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt",Swann's Way
7178,"dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however",Swann's Way
7178,"trivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it",Swann's Way
7178,"was no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to",Swann's Way
7178,have to envy them.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should",Swann's Way
7178,"hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper,",Swann's Way
7178,"and I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's",Swann's Way
7178,"sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a",Swann's Way
7178,fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious,Swann's Way
7178,"circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person",Swann's Way
7178,"to whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of",Swann's Way
7178,"managing to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his",Swann's Way
7178,"wife, but of his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was",Swann's Way
7178,understood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very",Swann's Way
7178,"hard for him.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"ideas. It would be utterly ridiculous.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave,Swann's Way
7178,rise to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the,Swann's Way
7178,"evenings when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma",Swann's Way
7178,"did not come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with",Swann's Way
7178,"the family: I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said",Swann's Way
7178,good night and went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier,Swann's Way
7178,"than the others, and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight",Swann's Way
7178,"o'clock, when it was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and",Swann's Way
7178,precious kiss which Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I,Swann's Way
7178,was in bed and just going to sleep I had to take with me from the,Swann's Way
7178,"dining-room to my own, and to keep inviolate all the time that it",Swann's Way
7178,"took me to undress, without letting its sweet charm be broken, without",Swann's Way
7178,letting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate; and just on,Swann's Way
7178,those very evenings when I must needs take most pains to receive it with,Swann's Way
7178,"due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it instantly and in public,",Swann's Way
7178,without even having the time or being properly free to apply to what I,Swann's Way
7178,was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to,Swann's Way
7178,exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a,Swann's Way
7178,"door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again",Swann's Way
7178,they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the,Swann's Way
7178,precise moment in which the door was shut.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded,Swann's Way
7178,"shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one",Swann's Way
7178,another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,"" my grandfather",Swann's Way

7178,But I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach,Swann's Way
7178,of me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Now, M. Swann,"" she said, ""do tell me about your daughter; I am sure",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of,Swann's Way
7178,"thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into",Swann's Way
7178,the discovery of their finest lines.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,"" she said, or",Swann's Way

7178,"sure that hers would agree with me.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not,Swann's Way
7178,"to think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that",Swann's Way
7178,"evening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I",Swann's Way
7178,"tried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really,",Swann's Way
7178,"since I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on",Swann's Way
7178,"thoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the",Swann's Way
7178,"terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this",Swann's Way
7178,"foreboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not",Swann's Way
7178,"allow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it,",Swann's Way
7178,but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of,Swann's Way
7178,"beauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or",Swann's Way
7178,"beguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can",Swann's Way
7178,look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed,Swann's Way

7178,"d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one",Swann's Way
7178,or amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question,Swann's Way

7178,"blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to",Swann's Way
7178,"underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"his having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was",Swann's Way
7178,"embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I think it would be worth while,"" Flora went on, ""to have this old",Swann's Way
7178,gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he,Swann's Way
7178,"will talk for hours on end.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""That must be delightful,"" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature",Swann's Way
7178,had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for,Swann's Way
7178,becoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the,Swann's Way
7178,ladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his,Swann's Way
7178,"parts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters",Swann's Way
7178,with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to,Swann's Way
7178,taste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private,Swann's Way
7178,life of Mole or of the Comte de Paris.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I say!"" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, ""what I was going to tell",Swann's Way
7178,you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me,Swann's Way
7178,"just now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came",Swann's Way
7178,across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused,Swann's Way
7178,you. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one,Swann's Way
7178,"of the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a",Swann's Way
7178,"journal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from",Swann's Way
7178,"the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days,",Swann's Way
7178,"morning, noon and night.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the",Swann's Way
7178,"papers very pleasant indeed!"" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that",Swann's Way
7178,she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes,"" aunt Céline went one better. ""When they write about things or",Swann's Way
7178,"people in whom we are interested.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I don't deny it,"" answered Swann in some bewilderment. ""The fault I",Swann's Way
7178,find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in,Swann's Way
7178,"some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four",Swann's Way
7178,books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose,Swann's Way
7178,"that, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered",Swann's Way
7178,"hands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside",Swann's Way
7178,"it--oh! I don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensées_?"" He articulated",Swann's Way
7178,"the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. ""And",Swann's Way
7178,"then, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,""",Swann's Way
7178,"he went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which",Swann's Way
7178,"some men of the world like to affect, ""we should read that the Queen of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had",Swann's Way
7178,given a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right,Swann's Way
7178,"proportion between 'information' and 'publicity.'"" But at once",Swann's Way
7178,"regretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of",Swann's Way
7178,"serious matters, he added ironically: ""We are having a most entertaining",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,"" and",Swann's Way
7178,"then, turning to my grandfather: ""Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier",Swann's Way
7178,had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he,Swann's Way

7178,"ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very",Swann's Way

7178,"her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.",Swann's Way
7178,Céline began to laugh.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My grandfather was already in ecstasies over ""ignorance or a trap,""",Swann's Way
7178,"but Miss Céline--the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having",Swann's Way

7178,angry.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is",Swann's Way

7178,What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long,Swann's Way
7178,as he is intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his,Swann's Way
7178,"children, your Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with",Swann's Way

7178,"for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him",Swann's Way
7178,"the stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: ""Just",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Good, that is, very good.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table,Swann's Way
7178,"I should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time,",Swann's Way
7178,"and that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to",Swann's Way
7178,give her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my,Swann's Way
7178,"room. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began",Swann's Way
7178,"to eat and drink and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand",Swann's Way
7178,"into this kiss, which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in",Swann's Way
7178,"execution, everything that my own efforts could put into it: would",Swann's Way
7178,look out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where I would,Swann's Way
7178,"imprint it, and would so prepare my thoughts that I might be able,",Swann's Way
7178,"thanks to these mental preliminaries, to consecrate the whole of the",Swann's Way
7178,minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my,Swann's Way
7178,"lips, as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only",Swann's Way
7178,"prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and from rough notes",Swann's Way
7178,does in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter's,Swann's Way
7178,"absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandfather said with unconscious cruelty: ""The little man looks tired;",Swann's Way
7178,"he'd better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in",Swann's Way
7178,"observing the letter of a treaty, went on: ""Yes, run along; to bed with",Swann's Way
7178,"you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the",Swann's Way
7178,dinner-bell rang.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, no, leave your mother alone. You've said good night quite enough.",Swann's Way
7178,"These exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the,Swann's Way
7178,"staircase 'against my heart,' as the saying is, climbing in opposition",Swann's Way
7178,"to my heart's desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had",Swann's Way
7178,"not, by her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That",Swann's Way
7178,"hateful staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out",Swann's Way
7178,"a smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and",Swann's Way
7178,"fixed the special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made",Swann's Way
7178,"it perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed",Swann's Way
7178,"this olfactory guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we",Swann's Way
7178,have gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it,Swann's Way
7178,"only as a little girl whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out",Swann's Way
7178,"of the water, or as a line of Molière which we repeat incessantly to",Swann's Way
7178,"ourselves, it is a great relief to wake up, so that our intelligence",Swann's Way
7178,can disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of,Swann's Way
7178,heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the precise converse of this relief,Swann's Way
7178,which I felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my,Swann's Way
7178,"consciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid, instantaneous almost,",Swann's Way
7178,a manner at once insidious and brutal as I breathed in--a far more,Swann's Way
7178,poisonous thing than any moral penetration--the peculiar smell of the,Swann's Way
7178,varnish upon that staircase.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to",Swann's Way
7178,"dig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the",Swann's Way
7178,shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which,Swann's Way
7178,"had been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the",Swann's Way
7178,"red curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted",Swann's Way
7178,the desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother,Swann's Way
7178,begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not,Swann's Way
7178,"put in writing. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt's cook who used to",Swann's Way
7178,"be put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my",Swann's Way
7178,"note. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to",Swann's Way
7178,my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly,Swann's Way
7178,"inconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre",Swann's Way
7178,to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might,Swann's Way
7178,"or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant,",Swann's Way
7178,"subtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or",Swann's Way
7178,"irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which",Swann's Way
7178,combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast,Swann's Way
7178,"with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against ""seething the kid",Swann's Way
7178,"in his mother's milk,"" or ""eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow",Swann's Way
7178,"of the thigh."" This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy",Swann's Way
7178,which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our,Swann's Way
7178,"instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and",Swann's Way
7178,refinements of fashion as nothing in Françoise's surroundings or in her,Swann's Way
7178,career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head;,Swann's Way
7178,and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past,Swann's Way
7178,"existence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood,",Swann's Way
7178,just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still,Swann's Way
7178,"testify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among",Swann's Way
7178,delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre,Swann's Way
7178,Fils Aymon.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it",Swann's Way
7178,highly improbable that--barring an outbreak of fire--Françoise would,Swann's Way
7178,go down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a,Swann's Way
7178,person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for,Swann's Way
7178,"the family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also",Swann's Way
7178,for the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have,Swann's Way
7178,"found touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her",Swann's Way
7178,"lips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter",Swann's Way
7178,"it, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred",Swann's Way
7178,character in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect,Swann's Way
7178,of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one,Swann's Way
7178,"chance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not",Swann's Way
7178,"in the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who,",Swann's Way
7178,"on saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her",Swann's Way
7178,"an answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would",Swann's Way
7178,certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses",Swann's Way
7178,"were so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs",Swann's Way
7178,"imperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that",Swann's Way
7178,we might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five,Swann's Way
7178,minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of,Swann's Way
7178,"my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents,",Swann's Way
7178,or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter.,Swann's Way
7178,Then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply:,Swann's Way
7178,"""What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,A moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage,Swann's Way
7178,"and that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once,",Swann's Way
7178,in front of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he,Swann's Way
7178,would find a way of slipping it into Mamma's hand. At once my anxiety,Swann's Way
7178,subsided; it was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until,Swann's Way
7178,"to-morrow that I had lost my mother, for my little line was going--to",Swann's Way
7178,"annoy her, no doubt, and doubly so because this contrivance would make",Swann's Way
7178,"me ridiculous in Swann's eyes--but was going all the same to admit me,",Swann's Way
7178,"invisibly and by stealth, into the same room as herself, was going",Swann's Way
7178,to whisper from me into her ear; for that forbidden and unfriendly,Swann's Way
7178,"dining-room, where but a moment ago the ice itself--with burned nuts in",Swann's Way
7178,it--and the finger-bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that,Swann's Way
7178,were mischievous and of a mortal sadness because Mamma was tasting of,Swann's Way
7178,"them and I was far away, had opened its doors to me and, like a ripe",Swann's Way
7178,"fruit which bursts through its skin, was going to pour out into my",Swann's Way
7178,intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma's attention while she,Swann's Way
7178,was reading what I had written. Now I was no longer separated from her;,Swann's Way
7178,"the barriers were down; an exquisite thread was binding us. Besides,",Swann's Way
7178,"that was not all, for surely Mamma would come.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann",Swann's Way
7178,would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had,Swann's Way
7178,"guessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due",Swann's Way
7178,"course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years,",Swann's Way
7178,and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so,Swann's Way
7178,"well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the",Swann's Way
7178,creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not,Swann's Way
7178,"and cannot follow--to him that anguish came through Love, to which it",Swann's Way
7178,"is in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but",Swann's Way
7178,"when, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one's soul before",Swann's Way
7178,"Love has yet entered into one's life, then it must drift, awaiting",Swann's Way
7178,"Love's coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the",Swann's Way
7178,"disposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety",Swann's Way
7178,or affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself,Swann's Way
7178,"apprentice, when Françoise returned to tell me that my letter would be",Swann's Way
7178,"delivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can",Swann's Way
7178,"give us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at",Swann's Way
7178,"the house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or",Swann's Way
7178,"'first-night' at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside,",Swann's Way
7178,desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He,Swann's Way
7178,"recognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there.",Swann's Way
7178,And when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his,Swann's Way
7178,"relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple,",Swann's Way
7178,"takes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five",Swann's Way
7178,minutes. How much we love him--as at that moment I loved Françoise--the,Swann's Way
7178,"good-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable,",Swann's Way
7178,"human, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in",Swann's Way
7178,"the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and",Swann's Way
7178,"seductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman",Swann's Way
7178,"whom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has",Swann's Way
7178,"accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries,",Swann's Way
7178,then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible,Swann's Way
7178,and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown,Swann's Way
7178,"pleasures--behold, a breach in the wall, and we are through it. Behold,",Swann's Way
7178,"one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment",Swann's Way
7178,"as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself",Swann's Way
7178,because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to,Swann's Way
7178,"ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created",Swann's Way
7178,"it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting",Swann's Way
7178,there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not,Swann's Way
7178,"be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so",Swann's Way
7178,"well able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that",Swann's Way
7178,"""Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more",Swann's Way
7178,"amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there."" Alas! Swann",Swann's Way
7178,had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are,Swann's Way
7178,powerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even,Swann's Way
7178,"into a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind",Swann's Way
7178,friend comes down again alone.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my",Swann's Way
7178,self-respect (which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she,Swann's Way
7178,had asked me to let her know the result of my search for something,Swann's Way
7178,"or other) made Françoise tell me, in so many words ""There is no",Swann's Way
7178,"answer""--words I have so often, since then, heard the hall-porters in",Swann's Way
7178,"'mansions' and the flunkeys in gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to",Swann's Way
7178,"some poor girl, who replies in bewilderment: ""What! he's said nothing?",Swann's Way
7178,"It's not possible. You did give him my letter, didn't you? Very well,",Swann's Way
7178,"I shall wait a little longer."" And just as she invariably protests that",Swann's Way
7178,she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for,Swann's Way
7178,"her, and sits on there, hearing nothing further, except an occasional",Swann's Way
7178,remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger,Swann's Way
7178,"whom he will send off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put some",Swann's Way
7178,"customer's wine on the ice; so, having declined Françoise's offer to",Swann's Way
7178,"make me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go off again to the",Swann's Way
7178,"servants' hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried not to hear the",Swann's Way
7178,voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma,",Swann's Way
7178,by approaching--at the risk of making her angry--so near to her that I,Swann's Way
7178,felt I could reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her,Swann's Way
7178,"again, I had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep",Swann's Way
7178,"until I actually had seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more",Swann's Way
7178,painfully as I increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm,Swann's Way
7178,"and to acquiesce in my ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided,",Swann's Way
7178,"a feeling of intense happiness coursed through me, as when a strong",Swann's Way
7178,medicine begins to take effect and one's pain vanishes: I had formed a,Swann's Way
7178,"resolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma,",Swann's Way
7178,"and had decided to kiss her at all costs, even with the certainty of",Swann's Way
7178,"being in disgrace with her for long afterwards, when she herself came",Swann's Way
7178,up to bed. The tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely,Swann's Way
7178,"alert, no less than my sense of expectation, my thirst for and my fear",Swann's Way
7178,of danger.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Noiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed;,Swann's Way
7178,hardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things,Swann's Way
7178,"outside seemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the",Swann's Way
7178,"moonlight which, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the",Swann's Way
7178,"extension, forwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its",Swann's Way
7178,"substance, had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer,",Swann's Way
7178,"like a map which, after being folded up, is spread out upon the ground.",Swann's Way
7178,"What had to move--a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance--moved. But",Swann's Way
7178,"its minute shuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with",Swann's Way
7178,"utmost delicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene,",Swann's Way
7178,"and yet was not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon",Swann's Way
7178,"this surface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most",Swann's Way
7178,"distant sounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end",Swann's Way
7178,"of the town, could be distinguished with such exact 'finish' that the",Swann's Way
7178,impression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their,Swann's Way
7178,"'pianissimo' execution, like those movements on muted strings so well",Swann's Way
7178,"performed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does",Swann's Way
7178,"not lose a single note, one thinks all the same that they are being",Swann's Way
7178,"played somewhere outside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all",Swann's Way
7178,"the old subscribers, and my grandmother's sisters too, when Swann had",Swann's Way
7178,"given them his seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught",Swann's Way
7178,"the distant approach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded",Swann's Way
7178,the corner of the Rue de Trévise.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which,Swann's Way
7178,none could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my,Swann's Way
7178,"parents' hands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would",Swann's Way
7178,"have imagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only",Swann's Way
7178,some really shameful fault. But in the system of education which they,Swann's Way
7178,had given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of,Swann's Way
7178,"other children, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list",Swann's Way
7178,(doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which,Swann's Way
7178,I needed to be more carefully protected) those in which I can now,Swann's Way
7178,distinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to,Swann's Way
7178,a nervous impulse. But such words as these last had never been uttered,Swann's Way
7178,in my hearing; no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way,Swann's Way
7178,which might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my,Swann's Way
7178,"giving in to them, or that I was actually incapable of holding out",Swann's Way
7178,against them. Yet I could easily recognise this class of transgressions,Swann's Way
7178,"by the anguish of mind which preceded, as well as by the rigour of the",Swann's Way
7178,punishment which followed them; and I knew that what I had just done was,Swann's Way
7178,in the same category as certain other sins for which I had been severely,Swann's Way
7178,"chastised, though infinitely more serious than they. When I went out to",Swann's Way
7178,"meet my mother as she herself came up to bed, and when she saw that I",Swann's Way
7178,"had remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage,",Swann's Way
7178,"I should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer, I should be",Swann's Way
7178,packed off to school next morning; so much was certain. Very good: had,Swann's Way
7178,"I been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself out of the window,",Swann's Way
7178,I should still have preferred such a fate. For what I wanted now was,Swann's Way
7178,"Mamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far along the road",Swann's Way
7178,which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my,Swann's Way
7178,steps.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I could hear my parents' footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when",Swann's Way
7178,"the rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to",Swann's Way
7178,the window. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster,Swann's Way
7178,"good, and whether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice.",Swann's Way
7178,"""I thought it rather so-so,"" she was saying; ""next time we shall have to",Swann's Way
7178,"try another flavour.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I can't tell you,"" said my great-aunt, ""what a change I find in Swann.",Swann's Way
7178,"He is quite antiquated!"" She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann",Swann's Way
7178,always in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to,Swann's Way
7178,find him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him.,Swann's Way
7178,"And the others too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal,",Swann's Way
7178,"excessive, scandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of",Swann's Way
7178,that class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow,Swann's Way
7178,"must be longer than for other men, since for such a one it is void of",Swann's Way
7178,"promise, and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any",Swann's Way

7178,"to guess what he paid for them.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my,Swann's Way

7178,"""As you wish, dear, though I don't feel in the least like sleeping. I",Swann's Way
7178,don't know why; it can't be the coffee-ice--it wasn't strong enough to,Swann's Way
7178,keep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants' hall: poor,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me",Swann's Way
7178,"while you go and undress.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the,Swann's Way
7178,staircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I,Swann's Way
7178,went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I,Swann's Way
7178,"could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety,",Swann's Way
7178,but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light,Swann's Way
7178,"coming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw",Swann's Way
7178,"myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not",Swann's Way
7178,realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression,Swann's Way
7178,"of anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used",Swann's Way
7178,"to go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences",Swann's Way
7178,than this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that,Swann's Way
7178,"further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility,",Swann's Way
7178,"and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as",Swann's Way
7178,"indicating that, with such a punishment as was in store for me, mere",Swann's Way
7178,"silence, and even anger, were relatively puerile.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one,Swann's Way
7178,converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice;,Swann's Way
7178,"the kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which",Swann's Way
7178,would have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being,Swann's Way
7178,angry with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the,Swann's Way
7178,"dressing-room, where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid",Swann's Way
7178,"the 'scene' which he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice",Swann's Way
7178,"half-stifled by her anger: ""Run away at once. Don't let your father see",Swann's Way
7178,"you standing there like a crazy jane!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But I begged her again to ""Come and say good night to me!"" terrified as",Swann's Way
7178,"I saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall,",Swann's Way
7178,"but also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope",Swann's Way
7178,"that my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must",Swann's Way
7178,"if she continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: ""Go back to",Swann's Way
7178,"your room. I will come.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one",Swann's Way
7178,"heard me, ""I am done for!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do",Swann's Way
7178,things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters,Swann's Way
7178,"granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to",Swann's Way
7178,"'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as",Swann's Way
7178,"'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at",Swann's Way
7178,"all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular",Swann's Way
7178,"walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of",Swann's Way
7178,"it was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening,",Swann's Way
7178,"long before the appointed hour he would snap out: ""Run along up to",Swann's Way
7178,"bed now; no excuses!"" But then again, simply because he was devoid",Swann's Way
7178,"of principles (in my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly",Swann's Way
7178,"speaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air",Swann's Way
7178,"of annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without",Swann's Way
7178,"some embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: ""Go along with him,",Swann's Way
7178,"then; you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his",Swann's Way
7178,"room for a little. I don't need anything.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But dear,"" my mother answered timidly, ""whether or not I feel like",Swann's Way
7178,"sleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""There's no question of making him accustomed,"" said my father, with",Swann's Way
7178,"a shrug of the shoulders; ""you can see quite well that the child is",Swann's Way
7178,"unhappy. After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill,",Swann's Way
7178,and a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the",Swann's Way
7178,"rest of the night. I'm off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you.",Swann's Way
7178,"Good night.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my,Swann's Way
7178,"sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring",Swann's Way
7178,"to move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white",Swann's Way
7178,"nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere",Swann's Way
7178,"in which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up",Swann's Way
7178,"his head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli",Swann's Way
7178,"which M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself",Swann's Way
7178,away from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of,Swann's Way
7178,"the staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually",Swann's Way
7178,"climb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have",Swann's Way
7178,"perished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have",Swann's Way
7178,"arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days",Swann's Way
7178,"I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of",Swann's Way
7178,"comprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able",Swann's Way
7178,"to tell Mamma to ""Go with the child."" Never again will such hours be",Swann's Way
7178,"possible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if",Swann's Way
7178,"I listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to",Swann's Way
7178,"control in my father's presence, and which broke out only when I found",Swann's Way
7178,"myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is",Swann's Way
7178,only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that,Swann's Way
7178,"I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively",Swann's Way
7178,drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would,Swann's Way
7178,"suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again",Swann's Way
7178,through the silent evening air.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so,Swann's Way
7178,"deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents",Swann's Way
7178,gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the,Swann's Way
7178,reward of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in,Swann's Way
7178,"this crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat",Swann's Way
7178,"arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him",Swann's Way
7178,and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance,Swann's Way
7178,expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what,Swann's Way
7178,"I called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that",Swann's Way
7178,"title less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his",Swann's Way
7178,"nature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own,",Swann's Way
7178,"had probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was",Swann's Way
7178,"every evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but",Swann's Way
7178,"they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering,",Swann's Way
7178,"which they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous",Swann's Way
7178,"sensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection",Swann's Way
7178,"for me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much",Swann's Way
7178,"courage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he",Swann's Way
7178,"had said to my mother: ""Go and comfort him."" Mamma stayed all night in",Swann's Way
7178,"my room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination",Swann's Way
7178,"those hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to",Swann's Way
7178,expect; for when Françoise (who guessed that something extraordinary,Swann's Way
7178,"must have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my",Swann's Way
7178,"hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: ""But, Madame, what is",Swann's Way
7178,"little Master crying for?"" she replied: ""Why, Françoise, he doesn't know",Swann's Way
7178,himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then,Swann's Way
7178,"go off to your own."" And thus for the first time my unhappiness was",Swann's Way
7178,"regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as",Swann's Way
7178,an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous,Swann's Way
7178,condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation,Swann's Way
7178,that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness,Swann's Way
7178,of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small,Swann's Way
7178,"degree of pride, either, in Françoise's presence at this return to humane",Swann's Way
7178,"conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my",Swann's Way
7178,"room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised",Swann's Way
7178,"me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort",Swann's Way
7178,"of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to have",Swann's Way
7178,been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a first,Swann's Way
7178,"concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first step",Swann's Way
7178,"down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first time",Swann's Way
7178,"she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck",Swann's Way
7178,me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had,Swann's Way
7178,"succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in",Swann's Way
7178,"relaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened",Swann's Way
7178,"a new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared",Swann's Way
7178,"now, I should have said to Mamma: ""No, I don't want you; you mustn't",Swann's Way
7178,"sleep here."" But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what",Swann's Way
7178,would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent,Swann's Way
7178,"idealism of my grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief",Swann's Way
7178,was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of,Swann's Way
7178,"her company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's",Swann's Way
7178,"beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she",Swann's Way
7178,"sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for",Swann's Way
7178,"that reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her",Swann's Way
7178,anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness,Swann's Way
7178,which my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and,Swann's Way
7178,secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first,Swann's Way
7178,"white hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then",Swann's Way
7178,"I saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length",Swann's Way
7178,"of tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to",Swann's Way
7178,"struggle to keep back her own. Then, as she saw that I had noticed",Swann's Way
7178,"this, she said to me, with a smile: ""Why, my little buttercup, my little",Swann's Way
7178,"canary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly as himself if this goes",Swann's Way
7178,"on. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't either, we mustn't",Swann's Way
7178,go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll get one of your,Swann's Way
7178,"books."" But I had none there. ""Would you like me to get out the books",Swann's Way
7178,now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday? Just,Swann's Way
7178,"think it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is nothing new",Swann's Way
7178,"for you then.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books",Swann's Way
7178,"in which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was",Swann's Way
7178,"wrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this",Swann's Way
7178,"first glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already",Swann's Way
7178,the paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year,Swann's Way
7178,"before. It contained _La Mare au Diable_, _François le Champi_, _La",Swann's Way
7178,"Petite Fadette_, and _Les Maîtres Sonneurs_. My grandmother, as I",Swann's Way
7178,"learned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of",Swann's Way
7178,"Rousseau, and _Indiana_; for while she considered light reading as",Swann's Way
7178,"unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she did not reflect that the strong",Swann's Way
7178,breath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence,Swann's Way
7178,at once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and,Swann's Way
7178,country breezes upon his body. But when my father had seemed almost to,Swann's Way
7178,regard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed,Swann's Way
7178,"to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to Jouy-le-Vicomte to",Swann's Way
7178,"the bookseller's, so that there should be no fear of my not having my",Swann's Way
7178,"present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come home so",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything,Swann's Way
7178,"from which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all,",Swann's Way
7178,that profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our,Swann's Way
7178,pleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth.,Swann's Way
7178,Even when she had to make some one a present of the kind called,Swann's Way
7178,"'useful,' when she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or",Swann's Way
7178,"a walking-stick, she would choose 'antiques,' as though their long",Swann's Way
7178,desuetude had effaced from them any semblance of utility and fitted,Swann's Way
7178,them rather to instruct us in the lives of the men of other days than,Swann's Way
7178,to serve the common requirements of our own. She would have liked me to,Swann's Way
7178,have in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places.,Swann's Way
7178,"But at the moment of buying them, and for all that the subject of the",Swann's Way
7178,"picture had an aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity",Swann's Way
7178,"and utility had too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical",Swann's Way
7178,nature of their reproduction by photography. She attempted by a,Swann's Way
7178,"subterfuge, if not to eliminate altogether their commercial banality,",Swann's Way
7178,"at least to minimise it, to substitute for the bulk of it what was",Swann's Way
7178,"art still, to introduce, as it might be, several 'thicknesses' of",Swann's Way
7178,"art; instead of photographs of Chartres Cathedral, of the Fountains",Swann's Way
7178,"of Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would inquire of Swann whether some",Swann's Way
7178,"great painter had not made pictures of them, and preferred to give me",Swann's Way
7178,"photographs of 'Chartres Cathedral' after Corot, of the 'Fountains of",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Cloud' after Hubert Robert, and of 'Vesuvius' after Turner, which",Swann's Way
7178,were a stage higher in the scale of art. But although the photographer,Swann's Way
7178,had been prevented from reproducing directly the masterpieces or the,Swann's Way
7178,"beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a great artist, he",Swann's Way
7178,resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing the artist's,Swann's Way
7178,"interpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with vulgarity,",Swann's Way
7178,my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still,Swann's Way
7178,"further. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been engraved,",Swann's Way
7178,"preferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of",Swann's Way
7178,"association apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a",Swann's Way
7178,"masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as",Swann's Way
7178,Morghen's print of the 'Cenacolo' of Leonardo before it was spoiled,Swann's Way
7178,by restoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of,Swann's Way
7178,interpreting the art of making presents were not always happy. The idea,Swann's Way
7178,"which I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to",Swann's Way
7178,"have the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than",Swann's Way
7178,what I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no,Swann's Way
7178,longer keep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an,Swann's Way
7178,indictment of my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented,Swann's Way
7178,"to married couples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down",Swann's Way
7178,upon them had at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient.,Swann's Way
7178,But my grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too,Swann's Way
7178,closely with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still,Swann's Way
7178,"be discerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And",Swann's Way
7178,"even what in such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a",Swann's Way
7178,"manner to which we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as",Swann's Way
7178,one of those old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a,Swann's Way
7178,metaphor whose fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our,Swann's Way
7178,modern tongue. In precisely the same way the pastoral novels of George,Swann's Way
7178,"Sand, which she was giving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms",Swann's Way
7178,"of antique furniture, full of expressions that have fallen out of use",Swann's Way
7178,"and returned as imagery, such as one finds now only in country dialects.",Swann's Way
7178,"And my grandmother had bought them in preference to other books, just as",Swann's Way
7178,"she would have preferred to take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or",Swann's Way
7178,some other such piece of antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on,Swann's Way
7178,"the mind, filling it with a nostalgic longing for impossible journeys",Swann's Way
7178,through the realms of time.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen _François le Champi_, whose",Swann's Way
7178,reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality,Swann's Way
7178,in my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real,Swann's Way
7178,novels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist.,Swann's Way
7178,That prepared me in advance to imagine that _François le Champi_,Swann's Way
7178,contained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the,Swann's Way
7178,"narrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain",Swann's Way
7178,"modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with",Swann's Way
7178,"a little experience, he may recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed",Swann's Way
7178,to me then distinctive--for to me a new book was not one of a number of,Swann's Way
7178,"similar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no",Swann's Way
7178,cause of existence beyond himself--an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar,Swann's Way
7178,"essence of _François le Champi_. Beneath the everyday incidents, the",Swann's Way
7178,"commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an",Swann's Way
7178,"intonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began:",Swann's Way
7178,"to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read",Swann's Way
7178,"to myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something",Swann's Way
7178,quite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge,Swann's Way
7178,of the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was,Swann's Way
7178,reading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd,Swann's Way
7178,changes which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and,Swann's Way
7178,"the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain,",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I",Swann's Way
7178,could readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of,Swann's Way
7178,"_Champi_, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own",Swann's Way
7178,"bright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful",Swann's Way
7178,"reader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which",Swann's Way
7178,she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her,Swann's Way
7178,interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was,Swann's Way
7178,"the same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and",Swann's Way
7178,women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe,Swann's Way
7178,"with what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from",Swann's Way
7178,"her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed",Swann's Way
7178,"some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an",Swann's Way
7178,event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the,Swann's Way
7178,"burden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some",Swann's Way
7178,"young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George",Swann's Way
7178,"Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral",Swann's Way
7178,distinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above,Swann's Way
7178,"all other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until",Swann's Way
7178,"much later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other",Swann's Way
7178,qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any,Swann's Way
7178,weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that,Swann's Way
7178,"powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness,",Swann's Way
7178,all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed,Swann's Way
7178,"to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak,",Swann's Way
7178,"within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required,",Swann's Way
7178,"with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated",Swann's Way
7178,"them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these",Swann's Way
7178,"means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be",Swann's Way
7178,"or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the",Swann's Way
7178,"preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the",Swann's Way
7178,melancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing,Swann's Way
7178,"to an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now",Swann's Way
7178,"slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their",Swann's Way
7178,"difference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this",Swann's Way
7178,"quite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,My agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this,Swann's Way
7178,gentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a,Swann's Way
7178,night could not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the,Swann's Way
7178,"world, namely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of",Swann's Way
7178,"darkness, ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes",Swann's Way
7178,of others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to,Swann's Way
7178,be anything but a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should,Swann's Way
7178,again be the victim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But,Swann's Way
7178,when these storms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise,Swann's Way
7178,"their existence; besides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off;",Swann's Way
7178,"I reminded myself that I should still have time to think about things,",Swann's Way
7178,"albeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power, albeit",Swann's Way
7178,"the coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will,",Swann's Way

7178,"night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than",Swann's Way
7178,"this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy",Swann's Way
7178,"background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign",Swann's Way
7178,will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other,Swann's Way

7178,"which would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the",Swann's Way
7178,"hall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase,",Swann's Way
7178,"so hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering",Swann's Way
7178,"'elevation' of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom,",Swann's Way
7178,with the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter;,Swann's Way
7178,"in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all",Swann's Way
7178,"its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy",Swann's Way
7178,"background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting",Swann's Way
7178,"one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in",Swann's Way
7178,"the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had",Swann's Way
7178,"consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though",Swann's Way
7178,there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night. I must own,Swann's Way
7178,that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other,Swann's Way
7178,scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts,Swann's Way
7178,which I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an,Swann's Way
7178,"exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures",Swann's Way
7178,which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of,Swann's Way
7178,"the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this",Swann's Way
7178,residue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Permanently dead? Very possibly.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"There is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second",Swann's Way

7178,effectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we,Swann's Way
7178,happen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"any existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my",Swann's Way
7178,"mother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did",Swann's Way
7178,"not ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular",Swann's Way
7178,"reason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump",Swann's Way
7178,"little cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they",Swann's Way
7178,"had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell. And soon,",Swann's Way
7178,"mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing",Swann's Way
7178,"morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked",Swann's Way
7178,"a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with",Swann's Way
7178,"it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I",Swann's Way
7178,"stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place.",Swann's Way
7178,"An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached,",Swann's Way
7178,with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life,Swann's Way
7178,"had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity",Swann's Way
7178,illusory--this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has,Swann's Way
7178,of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not,Swann's Way
7178,"in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental,",Swann's Way
7178,"mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was",Swann's Way
7178,"conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that",Swann's Way
7178,"it infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the",Swann's Way
7178,same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How,Swann's Way
7178,could I seize upon and define it?,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the",Swann's Way
7178,"first, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time",Swann's Way
7178,to stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object,Swann's Way
7178,"of my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has",Swann's Way
7178,"called up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat",Swann's Way
7178,"indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which",Swann's Way
7178,"I, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my",Swann's Way
7178,"disposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my",Swann's Way
7178,own mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss,Swann's Way
7178,of uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed,Swann's Way
7178,"beyond its own borders; when it, the seeker, is at once the dark region",Swann's Way
7178,"through which it must go seeking, where all its equipment will avail it",Swann's Way
7178,nothing. Seek? More than that: create. It is face to face with something,Swann's Way
7178,"which does not so far exist, to which it alone can give reality and",Swann's Way
7178,"substance, which it alone can bring into the light of day.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this",Swann's Way
7178,unremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its,Swann's Way
7178,"existence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a",Swann's Way
7178,real state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and,Swann's Way
7178,vanished. I decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts,Swann's Way
7178,to the moment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again,Swann's Way
7178,"the same state, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make",Swann's Way
7178,"one further effort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting",Swann's Way
7178,sensation. And that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out,Swann's Way
7178,"every obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all",Swann's Way
7178,"attention to the sounds which come from the next room. And then, feeling",Swann's Way
7178,"that my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report,",Swann's Way
7178,I compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which I have just,Swann's Way
7178,"denied it, to think of other things, to rest and refresh itself before",Swann's Way
7178,the supreme attempt. And then for the second time I clear an empty,Swann's Way
7178,space in front of it. I place in position before my mind's eye the still,Swann's Way
7178,"recent taste of that first mouthful, and I feel something start within",Swann's Way
7178,"me, something that leaves its resting-place and attempts to rise,",Swann's Way
7178,something that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth; I,Swann's Way
7178,"do not know yet what it is, but I can feel it mounting slowly; I can",Swann's Way
7178,"measure the resistance, I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must,Swann's Way
7178,"be the image, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has",Swann's Way
7178,tried to follow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too,Swann's Way
7178,"far off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless",Swann's Way
7178,reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of,Swann's Way
7178,"radiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as",Swann's Way
7178,"the one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its",Swann's Way
7178,"contemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea;",Swann's Way
7178,"cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of",Swann's Way
7178,what period in my past life.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this",Swann's Way
7178,"memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment",Swann's Way
7178,"has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the",Swann's Way
7178,"very depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has",Swann's Way
7178,"stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who",Swann's Way
7178,"can say whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task,",Swann's Way
7178,must lean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which,Swann's Way
7178,"deters us from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has",Swann's Way
7178,"urged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely",Swann's Way
7178,"of the worries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let",Swann's Way
7178,themselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb,Swann's Way
7178,of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those,Swann's Way
7178,"mornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good",Swann's Way
7178,"day to her in her bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it",Swann's Way
7178,first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the,Swann's Way
7178,little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it;,Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without",Swann's Way
7178,"tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image",Swann's Way
7178,had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among,Swann's Way
7178,"others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned",Swann's Way
7178,"and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the",Swann's Way
7178,"forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry,",Swann's Way
7178,"so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either",Swann's Way
7178,obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of,Swann's Way

7178,"alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more",Swann's Way
7178,"persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a",Swann's Way
7178,"long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the",Swann's Way

7178,recollection.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in,Swann's Way
7178,her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I,Swann's Way
7178,did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory,Swann's Way
7178,"made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where",Swann's Way
7178,"her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to",Swann's Way
7178,"the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out",Swann's Way
7178,behind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had,Swann's Way
7178,"been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to",Swann's Way
7178,"night and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon,",Swann's Way
7178,"the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took",Swann's Way
7178,when it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling,Swann's Way
7178,a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper,Swann's Way
7178,"which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they",Swann's Way
7178,"become wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it",Swann's Way
7178,"from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no",Swann's Way
7178,"more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it",Swann's Way
7178,"and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about",Swann's Way
7178,"its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as",Swann's Way
7178,"a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking",Swann's Way
7178,"houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and",Swann's Way
7178,"there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town",Swann's Way
7178,"in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing,",Swann's Way
7178,"like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the",Swann's Way
7178,"country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected",Swann's Way
7178,"long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun",Swann's Way
7178,"began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows;",Swann's Way
7178,"streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured",Swann's Way
7178,"in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood,",Swann's Way
7178,"the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in",Swann's Way
7178,colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me,Swann's Way
7178,"to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered",Swann's Way
7178,"above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the",Swann's Way
7178,projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able,Swann's Way
7178,"to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de",Swann's Way
7178,"l'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesché, from whose windows",Swann's Way
7178,in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in,Swann's Way
7178,"my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to",Swann's Way
7178,secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural,Swann's Way
7178,than it would be to make Golo's acquaintance and to chat with Geneviève,Swann's Way
7178,de Brabant.,Swann's Way

7178,My grandfather's cousin--by courtesy my great-aunt--with whom we used,Swann's Way
7178,"to stay, was the mother of that aunt Léonie who, since her husband's (my",Swann's Way
7178,"uncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray,",Swann's Way
7178,"then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed;",Swann's Way
7178,"and who now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite",Swann's Way
7178,"condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions,",Swann's Way
7178,and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue,Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pré (as",Swann's Way
7178,"distinct from the Petit-Pré, a green space in the centre of the town",Swann's Way
7178,"where three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three",Swann's Way
7178,"high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a",Swann's Way
7178,deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of,Swann's Way
7178,stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life,Swann's Way
7178,"was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she",Swann's Way
7178,would rest in the afternoon while they aired the other. They were rooms,Swann's Way
7178,of that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of,Swann's Way
7178,air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which,Swann's Way
7178,we cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours,Swann's Way
7178,"springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret",Swann's Way
7178,"system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which",Swann's Way
7178,"their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and",Swann's Way
7178,"coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside,",Swann's Way
7178,"but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful,",Swann's Way
7178,"limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left",Swann's Way
7178,"the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but",Swann's Way
7178,"plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar",Swann's Way
7178,"frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as",Swann's Way
7178,"a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which",Swann's Way
7178,"brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as",Swann's Way
7178,a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst,Swann's Way
7178,without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated,Swann's Way
7178,"with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I",Swann's Way
7178,"could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on",Swann's Way
7178,"those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could",Swann's Way
7178,"taste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before",Swann's Way
7178,I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time,Swann's Way
7178,"in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to",Swann's Way
7178,"warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides",Swann's Way
7178,"and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot,",Swann's Way
7178,making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in,Swann's Way
7178,"the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under",Swann's Way
7178,which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or,Swann's Way
7178,"snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of",Swann's Way
7178,shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to,Swann's Way
7178,"and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each",Swann's Way
7178,"one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking",Swann's Way
7178,like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room was,Swann's Way
7178,"thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had",Swann's Way
7178,"already 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed them and glazed them and",Swann's Way
7178,fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable,Swann's Way
7178,"country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour",Swann's Way
7178,"the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells",Swann's Way
7178,"of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper",Swann's Way
7178,I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the,Swann's Way
7178,"nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the",Swann's Way
7178,flowered quilt.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She,Swann's Way
7178,"never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was",Swann's Way
7178,"something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might",Swann's Way
7178,"displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when",Swann's Way
7178,"alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good",Swann's Way
7178,"for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it",Swann's Way
7178,would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she,Swann's Way
7178,"was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she",Swann's Way
7178,"attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance,",Swann's Way
7178,endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to,Swann's Way
7178,"keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate",Swann's Way
7178,"them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue",Swann's Way
7178,"which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the",Swann's Way
7178,"habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there",Swann's Way
7178,"was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying",Swann's Way
7178,"to herself: ""I must not forget that I never slept a wink""--for ""never",Swann's Way
7178,"sleeping a wink"" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted",Swann's Way
7178,and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Françoise,Swann's Way
7178,"would not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day,",Swann's Way
7178,"when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished",Swann's Way
7178,to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot,Swann's Way
7178,"herself as to say ""what made me wake up,"" or ""I dreamed that,"" she would",Swann's Way
7178,flush and at once correct herself.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would",Swann's Way
7178,"be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask",Swann's Way
7178,"instead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of",Swann's Way
7178,the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom,Swann's Way
7178,required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had,Swann's Way
7178,"twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping",Swann's Way
7178,"them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered",Swann's Way
7178,"their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous",Swann's Way
7178,"things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank",Swann's Way
7178,"sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded,",Swann's Way
7178,or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A,Swann's Way
7178,thousand trifling little details--the charming prodigality of the,Swann's Way
7178,chemist--details which would have been eliminated from an artificial,Swann's Way
7178,"preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the",Swann's Way
7178,"name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the",Swann's Way
7178,"train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not",Swann's Way
7178,"imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each",Swann's Way
7178,"new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these",Swann's Way
7178,little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but,Swann's Way
7178,"beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms",Swann's Way
7178,among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden,Swann's Way
7178,"roses--marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place",Swann's Way
7178,"of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree",Swann's Way
7178,which had and those which had not been 'in bloom'--shewed me that these,Swann's Way
7178,"were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package",Swann's Way
7178,had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still,Swann's Way
7178,"their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life",Swann's Way
7178,"which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.",Swann's Way
7178,"Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she",Swann's Way
7178,"would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of",Swann's Way
7178,which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of,Swann's Way
7178,"lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as",Swann's Way
7178,"high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of",Swann's Way
7178,"Vichy-Célestins, might be found her service-books and her medical",Swann's Way
7178,"prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed,",Swann's Way
7178,"of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and",Swann's Way
7178,for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she,Swann's Way
7178,"had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to",Swann's Way
7178,"night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily",Swann's Way
7178,"but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail",Swann's Way
7178,afterwards with Françoise.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me,Swann's Way
7178,away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad,Swann's Way
7178,"brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet",Swann's Way
7178,have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the,Swann's Way
7178,"points of a crown of thorns--or the beads of a rosary, and she would say",Swann's Way
7178,"to me: ""Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for",Swann's Way
7178,"mass; and if you see Françoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too",Swann's Way
7178,long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want,Swann's Way
7178,"anything.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not",Swann's Way
7178,at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to,Swann's Way
7178,"ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we",Swann's Way
7178,"spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went",Swann's Way
7178,"to Combray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in",Swann's Way
7178,"Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on",Swann's Way
7178,"New Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put",Swann's Way
7178,"a five-franc piece in my hand and said: ""Now, be careful. Don't make",Swann's Way
7178,"any mistake. Wait until you hear me say 'Good morning, Françoise,' and",Swann's Way
7178,"I touch your arm before you give it to her."" No sooner had we arrived",Swann's Way
7178,"in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a",Swann's Way
7178,"snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the",Swann's Way
7178,"concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise,",Swann's Way
7178,"motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like",Swann's Way
7178,the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to,Swann's Way
7178,this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested,Swann's Way
7178,"love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper",Swann's Way
7178,classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the,Swann's Way
7178,hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said,Swann's Way
7178,"in a loud voice: ""Good morning, Françoise."" At this signal my fingers",Swann's Way
7178,"parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused",Swann's Way
7178,but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was,Swann's Way
7178,"no one I knew better than Françoise. We were her favourites, and in the",Swann's Way
7178,"first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us",Swann's Way
7178,"as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in",Swann's Way
7178,addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those,Swann's Way
7178,invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a,Swann's Way
7178,"family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not",Swann's Way
7178,being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome,Swann's Way
7178,"us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us,",Swann's Way
7178,"on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an",Swann's Way
7178,"icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and",Swann's Way
7178,"if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of",Swann's Way
7178,"him, and whether he took after his granny.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise",Swann's Way
7178,"was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would",Swann's Way
7178,"speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and",Swann's Way
7178,their lives.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and",Swann's Way
7178,"that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the",Swann's Way
7178,"two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said",Swann's Way
7178,"to her, with a smile: ""Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away,",Swann's Way
7178,"and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but",Swann's Way
7178,"will make the best of it, won't you?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And Françoise answered, laughing: ""Madame knows everything; Madame",Swann's Way
7178,"is worse than the X-rays"" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation",Swann's Way
7178,"of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered",Swann's Way
7178,"woman's, daring to employ a scientific term) ""they brought here for Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,"Octave, which see what is in your heart""--and she went off, disturbed",Swann's Way
7178,"that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should",Swann's Way
7178,not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the,Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys",Swann's Way
7178,"and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or",Swann's Way
7178,pleasure to some one other than herself.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some extent,Swann's Way
7178,"during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services",Swann's Way
7178,"of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five",Swann's Way
7178,"o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and",Swann's Way
7178,"dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for",Swann's Way
7178,"churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a",Swann's Way
7178,"horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the",Swann's Way
7178,appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when,Swann's Way
7178,Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually,Swann's Way
7178,boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least,Swann's Way
7178,"satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take",Swann's Way
7178,"no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention,",Swann's Way
7178,"knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease",Swann's Way
7178,to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it;,Swann's Way
7178,"who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and",Swann's Way
7178,"mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not",Swann's Way
7178,"look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability,",Swann's Way
7178,"which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter",Swann's Way

7178,happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so,Swann's Way
7178,mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait,Swann's Way
7178,"until it was time for Françoise to come upstairs, and then a formidable",Swann's Way

7178,"seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn't",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"along and ring her sister's door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be",Swann's Way

7178,to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh! not before midday!"" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation,",Swann's Way
7178,"darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let",Swann's Way
7178,"it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a",Swann's Way
7178,keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to,Swann's Way
7178,"luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still",Swann's Way
7178,"before enjoying the spectacle. ""And it will come in the middle of",Swann's Way
7178,"my luncheon!"" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a",Swann's Way
7178,distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the,Swann's Way

7178,"one of the flat plates?"" These were the only plates which had pictures",Swann's Way
7178,on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the,Swann's Way

7178,"put on her spectacles and spell out: ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,""",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was",Swann's Way
7178,"as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be",Swann's Way
7178,forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the,Swann's Way
7178,"Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,",Swann's Way
7178,careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous,Swann's Way
7178,"monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either",Swann's Way
7178,"personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more",Swann's Way
7178,or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to,Swann's Way
7178,"be Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abbé Perdreau's",Swann's Way
7178,"niece come home from her convent, or the Curé's brother, a tax-collector",Swann's Way
7178,"at Châteaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to",Swann's Way
7178,Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed,Swann's Way
7178,by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't,Swann's Way
7178,"know at all,' simply because you had failed to recognise or identify",Swann's Way
7178,them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given,Swann's Way
7178,"warning that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I",Swann's Way
7178,"came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if",Swann's Way
7178,"I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux,",Swann's Way
7178,a man whom my grandfather didn't know:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""A man grandfather didn't know at all!"" she would exclaim. ""That's a",Swann's Way
7178,"likely story."" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by",Swann's Way
7178,"the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandfather would be summoned. ""Who can it have been that you passed",Swann's Way
7178,"near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn't know at all?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Why, of course I did,"" my grandfather would answer; ""it was Prosper,",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Ah, well!"" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still;",Swann's Way
7178,"""and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!""",Swann's Way
7178,"After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not",Swann's Way
7178,to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known,Swann's Way
7178,"in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to",Swann's Way
7178,see a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it,Swann's Way
7178,"incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem",Swann's Way
7178,all her inductive talent and her leisure hours.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,"" Françoise would suggest, without any",Swann's Way
7178,"real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should",Swann's Way
7178,not 'split her head.',Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!""--for my aunt's critical mind",Swann's Way

7178,"got the story from Théodore, ""as clever as a Christian, always in a good",Swann's Way
7178,"temper, always friendly, always everything that's nice. It's not often",Swann's Way
7178,"you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it's high",Swann's Way
7178,"time I left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's",Swann's Way
7178,"nearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They'll be coming back",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would have,Swann's Way
7178,accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it,Swann's Way
7178,"still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black,",Swann's Way
7178,"and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply",Swann's Way
7178,furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led,Swann's Way
7178,us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women,Swann's Way
7178,"going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had",Swann's Way
7178,"managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress",Swann's Way
7178,"itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels",Swann's Way
7178,upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its,Swann's Way
7178,"memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray,",Swann's Way
7178,"who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual",Swann's Way
7178,"pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time",Swann's Way
7178,"had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey",Swann's Way
7178,"and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky,",Swann's Way
7178,"frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning",Swann's Way
7178,the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their,Swann's Way
7178,"limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription,",Swann's Way
7178,bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed,Swann's Way
7178,"characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest",Swann's Way
7178,were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant,Swann's Way
7178,"as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside",Swann's Way
7178,you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was,Swann's Way
7178,"filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a",Swann's Way
7178,"playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between",Swann's Way
7178,"earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on",Swann's Way
7178,"weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those",Swann's Way
7178,"rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more",Swann's Way
7178,"luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to",Swann's Way
7178,"have almost a habitable air, like the hall--all sculptured stone and",Swann's Way
7178,"painted glass--of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat",Swann's Way
7178,"kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly",Swann's Way
7178,corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's,Swann's Way
7178,"and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy",Swann's Way
7178,"snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the",Swann's Way
7178,"window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like",Swann's Way
7178,"a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined",Swann's Way
7178,"by a sunrise--the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the",Swann's Way
7178,altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for,Swann's Way
7178,a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished,Swann's Way
7178,than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them,Swann's Way
7178,"were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity",Swann's Way
7178,sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare,Swann's Way
7178,brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There,Swann's Way
7178,was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little,Swann's Way
7178,"rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience",Swann's Way
7178,"of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a",Swann's Way
7178,ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision,Swann's Way
7178,"had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled",Swann's Way
7178,"by turns, a rare and transient fire--the next instant it had taken on",Swann's Way
7178,"all the iridescence of a peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a",Swann's Way
7178,"flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of",Swann's Way
7178,"the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were",Swann's Way
7178,along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was,Swann's Way
7178,"following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped",Swann's Way
7178,in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the,Swann's Way
7178,"deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on",Swann's Way
7178,"some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished,",Swann's Way
7178,"dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which",Swann's Way
7178,"could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in",Swann's Way
7178,"which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the",Swann's Way
7178,"straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came",Swann's Way
7178,"down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness",Swann's Way
7178,"of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime",Swann's Way
7178,"in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded",Swann's Way
7178,carpet of forget-me-nots in glass.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in,Swann's Way

7178,features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of,Swann's Way
7178,Guermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one,Swann's Way
7178,"another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch",Swann's Way
7178,of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the,Swann's Way
7178,yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have,Swann's Way
7178,"acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding",Swann's Way
7178,"atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in silk",Swann's Way
7178,"and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite 'gone' at the",Swann's Way
7178,"top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing",Swann's Way
7178,"upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong",Swann's Way
7178,"rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these,",Swann's Way
7178,the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me,Swann's Way
7178,"were almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was",Swann's Way
7178,"said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons",Swann's Way
7178,"of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of",Swann's Way
7178,which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way,Swann's Way
7178,"to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with",Swann's Way
7178,"amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little",Swann's Way
7178,people's supernatural passage--all these things made of the church for,Swann's Way
7178,me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building,Swann's Way
7178,"which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space--the name of the",Swann's Way
7178,"fourth being Time--which had sailed the centuries with that old nave,",Swann's Way
7178,"where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across",Swann's Way
7178,"and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each",Swann's Way
7178,"successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant,",Swann's Way
7178,hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness,Swann's Way
7178,"of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches,",Swann's Way
7178,"long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where,",Swann's Way
7178,"near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the",Swann's Way
7178,tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful,Swann's Way
7178,"gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up",Swann's Way
7178,"sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves",Swann's Way
7178,"smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger",Swann's Way
7178,brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked,Swann's Way
7178,"down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting",Swann's Way
7178,"down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through",Swann's Way
7178,"which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault,",Swann's Way
7178,"ribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone, Théodore or his",Swann's Way
7178,sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's little,Swann's Way
7178,"daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been",Swann's Way
7178,"bored, or so it was said, ""by a crystal lamp which, on the night when",Swann's Way
7178,"the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the",Swann's Way

7178,"coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From",Swann's Way
7178,"outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower",Swann's Way
7178,"level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced",Swann's Way
7178,"ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing",Swann's Way
7178,particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at,Swann's Way
7178,"an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall",Swann's Way
7178,"rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall",Swann's Way
7178,"all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to",Swann's Way
7178,"compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day,",Swann's Way
7178,"turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three",Swann's Way
7178,"alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn,",Swann's Way
7178,"crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead",Swann's Way
7178,and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that,Swann's Way
7178,"moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at",Swann's Way
7178,"Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in",Swann's Way
7178,"its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed ""The Church!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours,",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Loiseau's house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its",Swann's Way
7178,"walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might",Swann's Way
7178,have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne,Swann's Way
7178,"numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on",Swann's Way
7178,"his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau's and after leaving",Swann's Way
7178,"M. Rapin's, there existed, for all that, between the church and",Swann's Way
7178,everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of,Swann's Way
7178,demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind.,Swann's Way
7178,"In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which",Swann's Way
7178,developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times,Swann's Way
7178,"and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more",Swann's Way
7178,"important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life,",Swann's Way
7178,"than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark",Swann's Way
7178,front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at,Swann's Way
7178,all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they,Swann's Way
7178,"leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the",Swann's Way
7178,impression of an abyss.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of,Swann's Way
7178,Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath,Swann's Way
7178,which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought,Swann's Way
7178,"us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it",Swann's Way
7178,"slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering",Swann's Way
7178,"continually in all directions, he would say: ""Come, get your wraps",Swann's Way
7178,"together, we are there."" And on one of the longest walks we ever took",Swann's Way
7178,from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly,Swann's Way
7178,"on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over",Swann's Way
7178,"which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple,",Swann's Way
7178,but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched,Swann's Way
7178,on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a,Swann's Way
7178,"landscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this",Swann's Way
7178,single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make,Swann's Way
7178,"out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by",Swann's Way
7178,"its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first",Swann's Way
7178,"of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty",Swann's Way
7178,"morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the",Swann's Way
7178,"violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the",Swann's Way
7178,colour of the wild vine.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop",Swann's Way
7178,"to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair",Swann's Way
7178,"above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing",Swann's Way
7178,"to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released,",Swann's Way
7178,it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little,Swann's Way
7178,"while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed",Swann's Way
7178,"them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden",Swann's Way
7178,"uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had",Swann's Way
7178,struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the,Swann's Way
7178,"violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return",Swann's Way
7178,"and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some",Swann's Way
7178,"perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and",Swann's Way
7178,"swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull",Swann's Way
7178,"perches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without",Swann's Way
7178,"quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire",Swann's Way
7178,"that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her",Swann's Way
7178,"love--and deem rich in beneficent influences--nature itself, when the",Swann's Way
7178,"hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and",Swann's Way
7178,the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church,Swann's Way
7178,served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of,Swann's Way
7178,"general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that",Swann's Way
7178,"the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its",Swann's Way
7178,individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for,Swann's Way
7178,"the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in",Swann's Way
7178,the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the,Swann's Way
7178,"world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of",Swann's Way
7178,"architecture, she would say:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful,",Swann's Way
7178,but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it,Swann's Way
7178,"could play the piano, I am sure it would really _play_."" And when she",Swann's Way
7178,"gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent",Swann's Way
7178,"inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like",Swann's Way
7178,"hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the",Swann's Way
7178,outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it;,Swann's Way
7178,her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old,Swann's Way
7178,stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost,Swann's Way
7178,"pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight",Swann's Way
7178,"and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly",Swann's Way
7178,"far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks",Swann's Way
7178,"into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and,Swann's Way
7178,"consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view",Swann's Way
7178,in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its,Swann's Way
7178,"base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I",Swann's Way
7178,"saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun",Swann's Way
7178,"I would say to myself: ""Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for",Swann's Way
7178,"mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,""",Swann's Way
7178,and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the,Swann's Way
7178,"Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind",Swann's Way
7178,the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way,Swann's Way
7178,"to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a",Swann's Way
7178,"handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see",Swann's Way
7178,"what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready",Swann's Way
7178,"for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday",Swann's Way
7178,"coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes",Swann's Way
7178,"and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an",Swann's Way
7178,"air of enterprise, cunning, and success.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a",Swann's Way
7178,larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the,Swann's Way
7178,"fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of",Swann's Way
7178,"us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still",Swann's Way
7178,"of 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked",Swann's Way
7178,"its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from",Swann's Way
7178,my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night,Swann's Way
7178,"to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly,",Swann's Way
7178,"there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a",Swann's Way
7178,"brown velvet cushion, against--as being thrust into the pallid sky which",Swann's Way
7178,"had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room",Swann's Way
7178,"for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of",Swann's Way
7178,"the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence,",Swann's Way
7178,"to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality",Swann's Way
7178,beyond the power of words.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it",Swann's Way
7178,"could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with",Swann's Way
7178,"reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there,",Swann's Way
7178,"among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared",Swann's Way
7178,"thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which",Swann's Way
7178,"look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of",Swann's Way
7178,housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art,Swann's Way
7178,than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never,Swann's Way
7178,"forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming",Swann's Way
7178,"eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons,",Swann's Way
7178,"between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which",Swann's Way
7178,"descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself",Swann's Way
7178,hidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and,Swann's Way
7178,"completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so",Swann's Way
7178,"beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more",Swann's Way
7178,a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side,Swann's Way
7178,"by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple,",Swann's Way
7178,crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with,Swann's Way
7178,"glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I",Swann's Way
7178,"know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even",Swann's Way
7178,"a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell,",Swann's Way
7178,"sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the",Swann's Way
7178,"atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this",Swann's Way
7178,view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But,Swann's Way
7178,"since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my",Swann's Way
7178,"memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to",Swann's Way
7178,"contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not",Swann's Way
7178,"merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature",Swann's Way
7178,"without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole",Swann's Way
7178,section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the,Swann's Way
7178,steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw,Swann's Way
7178,"it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office,",Swann's Way
7178,"some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its",Swann's Way
7178,"isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in",Swann's Way
7178,"and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it",Swann's Way
7178,"ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it",Swann's Way
7178,"would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing",Swann's Way
7178,"further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in",Swann's Way
7178,"profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some",Swann's Way
7178,"unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the",Swann's Way
7178,"apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed",Swann's Way
7178,to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its,Swann's Way
7178,spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that,Swann's Way
7178,"one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up",Swann's Way
7178,"the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger",Swann's Way
7178,"of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of",Swann's Way
7178,"human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with",Swann's Way
7178,"them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter",Swann's Way
7178,"of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on",Swann's Way
7178,"the right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of",Swann's Way
7178,"a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical",Swann's Way
7178,"cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only",Swann's Way
7178,"find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone",Swann's Way
7178,"astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I",Swann's Way
7178,"had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing",Swann's Way
7178,"still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless,",Swann's Way
7178,"trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed",Swann's Way
7178,from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it,Swann's Way
7178,"again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now,",Swann's Way
7178,"I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a",Swann's Way
7178,corner... but... the goal is in my heart...,Swann's Way

7178,"On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who,",Swann's Way
7178,"detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could",Swann's Way
7178,only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray,Swann's Way
7178,between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class,Swann's Way
7178,"of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have",Swann's Way
7178,"proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different",Swann's Way
7178,"kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the",Swann's Way
7178,"specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation",Swann's Way
7178,profits. More 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware,Swann's Way
7178,"at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer,",Swann's Way
7178,and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer,Swann's Way
7178,"had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease",Swann's Way
7178,"in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are",Swann's Way
7178,"obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they",Swann's Way

7178,"Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair",Swann's Way
7178,"moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost",Swann's Way

7178,"he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an",Swann's Way
7178,"example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest",Swann's Way
7178,and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for,Swann's Way
7178,"speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using",Swann's Way
7178,"a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavallière neckties, his",Swann's Way
7178,"short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at",Swann's Way
7178,"the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy,",Swann's Way
7178,"at fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'--""undoubtedly,"" he would say,",Swann's Way

7178,"very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country",Swann's Way
7178,"gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such",Swann's Way
7178,"violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution",Swann's Way

7178,"or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give",Swann's Way
7178,Théodore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons,Swann's Way
7178,"like my aunt Léonie, to whom she would relate everything that had",Swann's Way
7178,occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional,Swann's Way
7178,pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family,Swann's Way
7178,of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Curé's,Swann's Way
7178,"linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of",Swann's Way
7178,Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that,Swann's Way
7178,"seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the",Swann's Way
7178,skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red,Swann's Way
7178,colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life,Swann's Way
7178,"of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend",Swann's Way
7178,Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from,Swann's Way
7178,"her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most,Swann's Way
7178,"detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid",Swann's Way
7178,"herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much",Swann's Way
7178,"care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no",Swann's Way
7178,outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting,Swann's Way
7178,smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good,Swann's Way
7178,"red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips",Swann's Way
7178,of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine,Swann's Way
7178,bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who,Swann's Way
7178,"appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,",Swann's Way
7178,in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those,Swann's Way

7178,"last a while yet""; each party alike might be certain that her doors",Swann's Way
7178,would never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look,Swann's Way
7178,"of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any",Swann's Way
7178,"of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were",Swann's Way
7178,"coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far",Swann's Way
7178,"more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never",Swann's Way
7178,"failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture",Swann's Way
7178,when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled,Swann's Way
7178,"with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior",Swann's Way
7178,"to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to",Swann's Way
7178,"see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that",Swann's Way
7178,"whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate",Swann's Way
7178,"with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in,Swann's Way
7178,"a minute: ""The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!"", twenty times",Swann's Way
7178,"Eulalie would retort with: ""Knowing your illness as you do, Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,"Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only",Swann's Way
7178,"yesterday."" For one of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the",Swann's Way
7178,formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled,Swann's Way
7178,"was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,Sazerin.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I do not ask to live to a hundred,"" my aunt would say, for she",Swann's Way
7178,preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to",Swann's Way
7178,"distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place",Swann's Way
7178,"regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent",Swann's Way
7178,"them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on",Swann's Way
7178,"those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with,",Swann's Way
7178,but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if,Swann's Way
7178,"Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the",Swann's Way
7178,"rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never",Swann's Way
7178,"cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of",Swann's Way
7178,"her symptoms in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door",Swann's Way
7178,"at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would",Swann's Way
7178,almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of,Swann's Way
7178,"nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended",Swann's Way
7178,Françoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that,Swann's Way
7178,she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But--and this more than ever,Swann's Way
7178,from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray--the,Swann's Way
7178,"proud hour of noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which",Swann's Way
7178,"it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown,",Swann's Way
7178,"would long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which",Swann's Way
7178,"too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still",Swann's Way
7178,"be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down",Swann's Way
7178,"by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and",Swann's Way
7178,"biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us,",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise would add--as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest",Swann's Way
7178,"of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and",Swann's Way
7178,"her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare,",Swann's Way
7178,like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals,Swann's Way
7178,"in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the",Swann's Way
7178,"seasons and the incidents of human life--a brill, because the fish-woman",Swann's Way
7178,"had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty",Swann's Way
7178,"in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she",Swann's Way
7178,"had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton,",Swann's Way
7178,because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time,Swann's Way
7178,"for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach,",Swann's Way
7178,"by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get;",Swann's Way
7178,"gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;",Swann's Way
7178,"raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first",Swann's Way
7178,"to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two",Swann's Way
7178,"years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an",Swann's Way
7178,"almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy",Swann's Way
7178,"loaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all",Swann's Way
7178,"these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but",Swann's Way
7178,"dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such",Swann's Way
7178,"things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the",Swann's Way
7178,"hand of Françoise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an",Swann's Way
7178,"'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her",Swann's Way
7178,"talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: ""No, thank you, I",Swann's Way
7178,"have finished; I am not hungry,"" would at once have been lowered to the",Swann's Way
7178,"level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one",Swann's Way
7178,"of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value",Swann's Way
7178,is the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the,Swann's Way
7178,tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to,Swann's Way
7178,"rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played,",Swann's Way
7178,and under the composer's very eyes.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At length my mother would say to me: ""Now, don't stay here all day;",Swann's Way
7178,"you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little",Swann's Way
7178,"fresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented",Swann's Way
7178,"here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender,",Swann's Way
7178,"allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a",Swann's Way
7178,"lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by",Swann's Way
7178,"a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected",Swann's Way
7178,"soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and",Swann's Way
7178,"apparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see",Swann's Way
7178,its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the,Swann's Way
7178,cave of Françoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing,Swann's Way
7178,"with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come",Swann's Way
7178,sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of,Swann's Way
7178,their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a,Swann's Way
7178,dove.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which,Swann's Way
7178,"surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would",Swann's Way
7178,"steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of",Swann's Way
7178,my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a,Swann's Way
7178,"major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its",Swann's Way
7178,"opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun",Swann's Way
7178,"which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and",Swann's Way
7178,"yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned",Swann's Way
7178,"kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one",Swann's Way
7178,goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into,Swann's Way
7178,"my uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account",Swann's Way
7178,"of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault,",Swann's Way
7178,"and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris,",Swann's Way
7178,"I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon,",Swann's Way
7178,"wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a",Swann's Way
7178,"working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain",Swann's Way
7178,that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being,Swann's Way
7178,"neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would",Swann's Way
7178,"cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted,",Swann's Way
7178,"whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted",Swann's Way
7178,"blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as",Swann's Way
7178,"at my grandparents', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his",Swann's Way
7178,"'study,' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against",Swann's Way
7178,"a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular",Swann's Way
7178,under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about,Swann's Way
7178,"them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and",Swann's Way
7178,which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and,Swann's Way
7178,"consistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely,",Swann's Way
7178,that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my,Swann's Way
7178,"uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him",Swann's Way
7178,at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost,Swann's Way
7178,"in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to",Swann's Way
7178,"disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his",Swann's Way
7178,"answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of",Swann's Way
7178,"hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: ""A quarter past",Swann's Way
7178,"two,"" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing",Swann's Way
7178,"them: ""A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of",Swann's Way
7178,"necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and",Swann's Way
7178,so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be,Swann's Way
7178,"enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked,",Swann's Way
7178,"as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for",Swann's Way
7178,"himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles",Swann's Way
7178,presented to the rest of the audience individually.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays,Swann's Way
7178,it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the,Swann's Way
7178,"dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took",Swann's Way
7178,their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the,Swann's Way
7178,"title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and",Swann's Way
7178,"wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless",Swann's Way
7178,"it were such strange titles as the _Testament de César Girodot, or",Swann's Way
7178,"Oedipe-Roi_, inscribed not on the green bills of the Opéra-Comique, but",Swann's Way
7178,"on the wine-coloured bills of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed",Swann's Way
7178,to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of,Swann's Way
7178,"the _Diamants de la Couronne_ than the sleek, mysterious satin of the",Swann's Way
7178,"_Domino Noir_; and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit",Swann's Way
7178,"to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I",Swann's Way
7178,would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title,Swann's Way
7178,"of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to",Swann's Way
7178,"snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to",Swann's Way
7178,"compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the",Swann's Way
7178,"end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle,",Swann's Way
7178,"velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I",Swann's Way
7178,"should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to",Swann's Way
7178,choose between _rice à l'Impératrice_ and the famous cream of chocolate.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art,",Swann's Way
7178,"although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its",Swann's Way
7178,numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its,Swann's Way
7178,enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and,Swann's Way
7178,"another's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an",Swann's Way
7178,incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would,Swann's Way
7178,arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to,Swann's Way
7178,murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified,Swann's Way
7178,"in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the",Swann's Way
7178,"master's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would",Swann's Way
7178,"always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres,",Swann's Way
7178,"and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second",Swann's Way
7178,"Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron,",Swann's Way
7178,"or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of",Swann's Way
7178,"Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in",Swann's Way
7178,"which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which",Swann's Way
7178,"the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip",Swann's Way
7178,"down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of",Swann's Way
7178,budding and blossoming life.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of",Swann's Way
7178,"Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Théâtre-Français, had plunged",Swann's Way
7178,"me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the",Swann's Way
7178,"name of a 'star,' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more,",Swann's Way
7178,"seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the",Swann's Way
7178,"hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who,",Swann's Way
7178,"I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting",Swann's Way
7178,"disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her",Swann's Way
7178,private life.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah",Swann's Way
7178,"Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was",Swann's Way
7178,"interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and",Swann's Way
7178,"also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses",Swann's Way
7178,in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to,Swann's Way
7178,"see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies",Swann's Way
7178,might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least,Swann's Way
7178,"thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who",Swann's Way
7178,had perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding,Swann's Way
7178,titles were probably no more than _noms de guerre_) the compliment of,Swann's Way
7178,presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some,Swann's Way
7178,"of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with",Swann's Way
7178,"my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother:",Swann's Way
7178,"""One of your uncle's friends,"" and I would think of the weary novitiate",Swann's Way
7178,"through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real",Swann's Way
7178,"importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such",Swann's Way
7178,"lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter",Swann's Way
7178,drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little,Swann's Way
7178,jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in,Swann's Way
7178,"his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for",Swann's Way
7178,him an intimate friend.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so--on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been",Swann's Way
7178,"altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than",Swann's Way
7178,"once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my",Swann's Way
7178,"uncle--one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I",Swann's Way
7178,took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier,Swann's Way
7178,"than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on",Swann's Way
7178,"their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied,",Swann's Way
7178,I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and,Swann's Way
7178,"pair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's",Swann's Way
7178,buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a,Swann's Way
7178,"woman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of",Swann's Way
7178,"shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and",Swann's Way
7178,said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he,Swann's Way
7178,"went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard",Swann's Way
7178,"before said: ""Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be",Swann's Way
7178,"so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother",Swann's Way
7178,"(your niece, isn't she?) beside it? The image of her, isn't he? I should",Swann's Way
7178,"so like to see the little chap, just for a second.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the,Swann's Way
7178,manservant told me to come in.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my,Swann's Way

7178,"in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat,",Swann's Way
7178,sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty,Swann's Way
7178,"whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush,",Swann's Way
7178,"and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be",Swann's Way
7178,"obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked",Swann's Way
7178,"at me and smiled; my uncle said ""My nephew!"" without telling her my name",Swann's Way
7178,"or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with",Swann's Way
7178,"my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any",Swann's Way
7178,association of his family with this other class of acquaintance.,Swann's Way

7178,certainly I should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had I,Swann's Way
7178,"not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had",Swann's Way
7178,"I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them.",Swann's Way
7178,But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her,Swann's Way
7178,flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away,Swann's Way
7178,"upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet,",Swann's Way
7178,"when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed",Swann's Way
7178,"me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and",Swann's Way
7178,"recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a",Swann's Way
7178,"novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home",Swann's Way
7178,of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind,Swann's Way
7178,"which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised",Swann's Way
7178,"to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the",Swann's Way
7178,"intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me",Swann's Way
7178,"regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who",Swann's Way
7178,was no longer of a family at all.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"We had gone by this time into the 'study,' and my uncle, who seemed a",Swann's Way
7178,"trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, thank you, dear friend,"" she said. ""You know I only smoke the ones",Swann's Way
7178,"the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous."" And",Swann's Way
7178,"she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in",Swann's Way
7178,"a foreign language. ""Why, yes,"" she began again suddenly. ""Of course I",Swann's Way
7178,have met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on,Swann's Way
7178,"earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,"" she",Swann's Way
7178,"went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what",Swann's Way
7178,"must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been",Swann's Way
7178,"so charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked,",Swann's Way
7178,"as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the",Swann's Way
7178,excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality.,Swann's Way
7178,It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part,Swann's Way
7178,"played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote",Swann's Way
7178,"all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of",Swann's Way
7178,"sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise",Swann's Way
7178,"the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame",Swann's Way
7178,"of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the",Swann's Way
7178,fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched,Swann's Way
7178,and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the,Swann's Way
7178,"smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat,",Swann's Way
7178,"with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the",Swann's Way
7178,"refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same",Swann's Way
7178,"way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up",Swann's Way
7178,"delicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a",Swann's Way
7178,"glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility",Swann's Way
7178,"and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work",Swann's Way
7178,"of art, into something altogether charming.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,"" said my uncle.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady,Swann's Way
7178,"in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a",Swann's Way
7178,forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to,Swann's Way
7178,"myself ""Shall I do it, shall I not?"" and then I ceased to ask myself",Swann's Way
7178,"what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly,",Swann's Way
7178,"madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such",Swann's Way
7178,"action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Isn't he delicious! Quite a ladies' man already; he takes after his",Swann's Way
7178,"uncle. He'll be a perfect 'gentleman,'"" she went on, setting her teeth",Swann's Way
7178,"so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. ""Couldn't he come",Swann's Way
7178,"to me some day for 'a cup of tea,' as our friends across the channel",Swann's Way
7178,"say; he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be. I did not understand,Swann's Way
7178,"half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be",Swann's Way
7178,concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to,Swann's Way
7178,"answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was",Swann's Way
7178,beginning to feel extremely tired.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, no; it is impossible,"" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. ""He",Swann's Way
7178,is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings,Swann's Way
7178,"back all the prizes from his school,"" he added in a lower tone, so that",Swann's Way
7178,I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction.,Swann's Way
7178,"""You can't tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of",Swann's Way
7178,"Vaulabelle, don't you know.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, I love artistic people,"" replied the lady in pink; ""there is no",Swann's Way
7178,"one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like",Swann's Way
7178,"yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is",Swann's Way
7178,it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You,Swann's Way
7178,"know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me",Swann's Way
7178,"out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my",Swann's Way
7178,"old uncle's tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he,",Swann's Way
7178,"awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that",Swann's Way
7178,"he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured",Swann's Way
7178,"him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an",Swann's Way
7178,impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of,Swann's Way
7178,expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me,Swann's Way
7178,"that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did",Swann's Way
7178,not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new,Swann's Way
7178,"importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let",Swann's Way
7178,"them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid",Swann's Way
7178,that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any,Swann's Way
7178,"unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not",Swann's Way
7178,wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in,Swann's Way
7178,a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not,Swann's Way
7178,"some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some",Swann's Way
7178,woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget,Swann's Way
7178,"to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a",Swann's Way
7178,"silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else,",Swann's Way
7178,that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles,Swann's Way
7178,with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be,Swann's Way
7178,applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in,Swann's Way
7178,the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my,Swann's Way
7178,uncle's I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment,Swann's Way
7178,I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had,Swann's Way
7178,recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested,Swann's Way
7178,they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's,Swann's Way
7178,conduct. My father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent,Swann's Way
7178,"order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in",Swann's Way
7178,"the street as he drove by in an open carriage, Î felt at once all the",Swann's Way
7178,"grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to",Swann's Way
7178,him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to,Swann's Way
7178,"raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make",Swann's Way
7178,him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the,Swann's Way
7178,commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a,Swann's Way
7178,"gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I",Swann's Way
7178,was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he,Swann's Way
7178,"did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him",Swann's Way
7178,again.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept,Swann's Way
7178,"shut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts",Swann's Way
7178,of the back-kitchen until Françoise appeared on its threshold and,Swann's Way
7178,"announced: ""I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take",Swann's Way
7178,"up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,"" I would then",Swann's Way
7178,"decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read.",Swann's Way
7178,"The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution",Swann's Way
7178,to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and,Swann's Way
7178,continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human,Swann's Way
7178,shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the,Swann's Way
7178,same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such,Swann's Way
7178,"quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress",Swann's Way
7178,"them was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when",Swann's Way
7178,"we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that",Swann's Way
7178,Françoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so,Swann's Way
7178,"much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in",Swann's Way
7178,"bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day,",Swann's Way
7178,whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample,Swann's Way
7178,smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of,Swann's Way
7178,"the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given",Swann's Way
7178,"me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he",Swann's Way
7178,"inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: ""Well, how goes it with",Swann's Way
7178,"Giotto's Charity?"" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled",Swann's Way
7178,"and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical,",Swann's Way
7178,"squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins,",Swann's Way
7178,"so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are",Swann's Way
7178,personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues,Swann's Way
7178,and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as,Swann's Way
7178,the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which,Swann's Way
7178,"she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant,",Swann's Way
7178,without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and,Swann's Way
7178,"spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather",Swann's Way
7178,"heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is",Swann's Way
7178,about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena,Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung",Swann's Way
7178,"upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for",Swann's Way
7178,it seems impossible that any thought of charity can ever have found,Swann's Way
7178,expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the,Swann's Way
7178,painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at,Swann's Way
7178,"her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to",Swann's Way
7178,"extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of",Swann's Way
7178,sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart,Swann's Way
7178,"to God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might",Swann's Way
7178,hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to,Swann's Way
7178,some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level,Swann's Way
7178,"above. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of",Swann's Way
7178,"envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and",Swann's Way
7178,is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips,Swann's Way
7178,"of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that",Swann's Way
7178,"the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who",Swann's Way
7178,"is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves",Swann's Way
7178,"for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours",Swann's Way
7178,"are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to",Swann's Way
7178,spare for envious thoughts.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures,Swann's Way
7178,"of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing",Swann's Way
7178,in our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that,Swann's Way
7178,"Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much",Swann's Way
7178,"as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the",Swann's Way
7178,"glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of",Swann's Way
7178,"the operator's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular",Swann's Way
7178,features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain,Swann's Way
7178,good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to,Swann's Way
7178,"see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces",Swann's Way
7178,of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting,Swann's Way
7178,"strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part",Swann's Way
7178,"played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these",Swann's Way
7178,"were depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere",Swann's Way
7178,"expressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled,",Swann's Way
7178,"added something more precise and more literal to their meaning,",Swann's Way
7178,something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted.,Swann's Way
7178,"And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention",Swann's Way
7178,incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the,Swann's Way
7178,"same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of",Swann's Way
7178,"death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal,",Swann's Way
7178,"intestinal aspect, towards that 'seamy side' of death which is, as it",Swann's Way
7178,"happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them",Swann's Way
7178,"to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a",Swann's Way
7178,"difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to",Swann's Way
7178,which we are accustomed to give the name of Death?,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and,Swann's Way
7178,"Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as",Swann's Way
7178,"the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less",Swann's Way
7178,"allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack)",Swann's Way
7178,of participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own,Swann's Way
7178,"special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which,",Swann's Way
7178,"if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical.",Swann's Way
7178,"Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet",Swann's Way
7178,"with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical",Swann's Way
7178,"charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and",Swann's Way
7178,"slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern",Swann's Way
7178,"no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and",Swann's Way
7178,"no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the",Swann's Way
7178,sublime face of true goodness.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Then while the kitchen-maid--who, all unawares, made the superior",Swann's Way
7178,"qualities of Françoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by",Swann's Way
7178,"force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth--took in coffee which",Swann's Way
7178,"(according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried",Swann's Way
7178,"up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying",Swann's Way
7178,"stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled",Swann's Way
7178,"with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the",Swann's Way
7178,"afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however,",Swann's Way
7178,a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden,Swann's Way
7178,"wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner,",Swann's Way
7178,like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for,Swann's Way
7178,"me to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was",Swann's Way
7178,"derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cure,",Swann's Way
7178,by Camus (whom Françoise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and,Swann's Way
7178,"that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from",Swann's Way
7178,"which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din",Swann's Way
7178,"of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed",Swann's Way
7178,to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who,Swann's Way
7178,"performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the",Swann's Way
7178,chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from,Swann's Way
7178,"an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a",Swann's Way
7178,"fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies'",Swann's Way
7178,"music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie--born of",Swann's Way
7178,"sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something",Swann's Way
7178,"of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our",Swann's Way
7178,"memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they",Swann's Way
7178,"are close around us, immediately accessible.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street,Swann's Way
7178,"what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous,",Swann's Way
7178,"and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which",Swann's Way
7178,"my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in",Swann's Way
7178,"fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose,",Swann's Way
7178,"which (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just",Swann's Way
7178,"excited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running",Swann's Way
7178,"water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had",Swann's Way
7178,"broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up",Swann's Way
7178,"and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I",Swann's Way
7178,"would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little",Swann's Way
7178,"sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I",Swann's Way
7178,used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might,Swann's Way
7178,be coming to call upon the family.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole,",Swann's Way
7178,in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain,Swann's Way
7178,invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw,Swann's Way
7178,"any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain",Swann's Way
7178,"between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which",Swann's Way
7178,prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material,Swann's Way
7178,form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch,Swann's Way
7178,"it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet",Swann's Way
7178,"never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by",Swann's Way
7178,"a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different",Swann's Way
7178,"states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold",Swann's Way
7178,"while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden",Swann's Way
7178,aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon,Swann's Way
7178,"spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the",Swann's Way
7178,"first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever",Swann's Way
7178,"whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the",Swann's Way
7178,"philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire",Swann's Way
7178,"to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if",Swann's Way
7178,"I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose",Swann's Way
7178,grocery lay too far from our house for Françoise to be able to deal,Swann's Way
7178,"there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a",Swann's Way
7178,"stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to",Swann's Way
7178,keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which,Swann's Way
7178,"adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more",Swann's Way
7178,"teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed",Swann's Way
7178,and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which,Swann's Way
7178,"had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the",Swann's Way
7178,"school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be",Swann's Way
7178,"entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me,",Swann's Way
7178,"half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but",Swann's Way
7178,permanent object of my thoughts.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be",Swann's Way
7178,"constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the",Swann's Way
7178,"discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in",Swann's Way
7178,"which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with",Swann's Way
7178,"more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole",Swann's Way
7178,lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was,Swann's Way
7178,reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what,Swann's Way
7178,Françoise would have called 'real people.' But none of the feelings,Swann's Way
7178,which the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be,Swann's Way
7178,awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes;,Swann's Way
7178,and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding,Swann's Way
7178,"that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated",Swann's Way
7178,"structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted",Swann's Way
7178,"in the suppression, pure and simple, of 'real' people would be a decided",Swann's Way
7178,"improvement. A 'real' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him,",Swann's Way
7178,"is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to",Swann's Way
7178,"say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities",Swann's Way
7178,"have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is",Swann's Way
7178,only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that,Swann's Way
7178,we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small,Swann's Way
7178,section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of,Swann's Way
7178,feeling any emotion either. The novelist's happy discovery was to think,Swann's Way
7178,"of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human",Swann's Way
7178,"spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which",Swann's Way
7178,the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the,Swann's Way
7178,"actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in",Swann's Way
7178,"the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in",Swann's Way
7178,"ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall,",Swann's Way
7178,"while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened",Swann's Way
7178,breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that,Swann's Way
7178,"state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is",Swann's Way
7178,"multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might",Swann's Way
7178,"a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than",Swann's Way
7178,"those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour",Swann's Way
7178,"he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of",Swann's Way
7178,"which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting",Swann's Way
7178,"to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have",Swann's Way
7178,been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops,Swann's Way
7178,"our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and",Swann's Way
7178,that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by,Swann's Way
7178,"imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural",Swann's Way
7178,"phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish,",Swann's Way
7178,"successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the",Swann's Way
7178,actual sensation of change.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human",Swann's Way
7178,"element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,"of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which",Swann's Way
7178,"made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual",Swann's Way
7178,landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In,Swann's Way
7178,"this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then",Swann's Way
7178,"reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless",Swann's Way
7178,"vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of",Swann's Way
7178,"wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and",Swann's Way
7178,"clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was",Swann's Way
7178,always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with,Swann's Way
7178,"her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the",Swann's Way
7178,"freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the",Swann's Way
7178,"woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once",Swann's Way
7178,spring up on either side of her like complementary colours.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever,Swann's Way
7178,"distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not",Swann's Way
7178,its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the,Swann's Way
7178,scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly,Swann's Way
7178,portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before,Swann's Way
7178,my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that,Swann's Way
7178,"the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which",Swann's Way
7178,"my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might",Swann's Way
7178,"be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the",Swann's Way
7178,impression--one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which,Swann's Way
7178,"I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished",Swann's Way
7178,product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my,Swann's Way
7178,"grandmother so despised--of their being actually part of Nature herself,",Swann's Way
7178,and worthy to be studied and explored.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the",Swann's Way
7178,"country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous",Swann's Way
7178,advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have,Swann's Way
7178,"the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul,",Swann's Way
7178,still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem,Swann's Way
7178,"to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it,",Swann's Way
7178,"to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear",Swann's Way
7178,"endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from",Swann's Way
7178,"without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to",Swann's Way
7178,"discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual",Swann's Way
7178,"glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned,",Swann's Way
7178,and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm,Swann's Way
7178,"which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas;",Swann's Way
7178,sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so,Swann's Way
7178,"as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well",Swann's Way
7178,"know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And",Swann's Way
7178,"so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever",Swann's Way
7178,"places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings",Swann's Way
7178,"it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an",Swann's Way
7178,"unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association",Swann's Way
7178,"of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were",Swann's Way
7178,only moments--which I isolate artificially to-day as though I,Swann's Way
7178,"were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water,",Swann's Way
7178,rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion--were only drops,Swann's Way
7178,"in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my",Swann's Way
7178,life.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions",Swann's Way
7178,"from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and",Swann's Way
7178,"before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting",Swann's Way
7178,"the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and,",Swann's Way
7178,"when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what",Swann's Way
7178,was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the,Swann's Way
7178,"last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the",Swann's Way
7178,"silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky",Swann's Way
7178,"above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading,",Swann's Way
7178,until the good dinner which Françoise was even now preparing should come,Swann's Way
7178,to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero,Swann's Way
7178,"through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to",Swann's Way
7178,me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest,Swann's Way
7178,"would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface,",Swann's Way
7178,and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed,Swann's Way
7178,into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden,Swann's Way
7178,figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would,Swann's Way
7178,sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour,Swann's Way
7178,which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not,Swann's Way
7178,"taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the",Swann's Way
7178,"deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated",Swann's Way
7178,the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping,Swann's Way
7178,silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace",Swann's Way
7178,"incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange",Swann's Way
7178,"adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still",Swann's Way
7178,"recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you,",Swann's Way
7178,and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little,Swann's Way
7178,drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat,Swann's Way
7178,"of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering",Swann's Way
7178,"in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent,",Swann's Way
7178,"sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon,",Swann's Way
7178,"by the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing,",Swann's Way
7178,"overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a",Swann's Way
7178,"tooth, and screaming out ""They're coming, they're coming!"" so that",Swann's Way
7178,Françoise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That,Swann's Way
7178,was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some,Swann's Way
7178,"military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While",Swann's Way
7178,"our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden",Swann's Way
7178,"railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and",Swann's Way
7178,"were stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which",Swann's Way
7178,"there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would",Swann's Way
7178,have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in,Swann's Way
7178,"with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling",Swann's Way
7178,"horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning",Swann's Way
7178,the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river,Swann's Way
7178,in flood.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Poor children,"" Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she",Swann's Way
7178,"had reached the railings; ""poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a",Swann's Way
7178,"meadow. It's just shocking to think of,"" she would go on, laying a hand",Swann's Way
7178,"over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not",Swann's Way
7178,"caring two straws for their lives?"" the gardener would ask, just to",Swann's Way
7178,'draw' her. And he would not have spoken in vain.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that",Swann's Way
7178,"we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never",Swann's Way
7178,"offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same;",Swann's Way
7178,"it's quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those",Swann's Way
7178,wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing,Swann's Way
7178,more nor less than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a,Swann's Way
7178,"rope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions."" For",Swann's Way
7178,"by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to",Swann's Way
7178,"pronounce 'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see,Swann's Way
7178,"people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap",Swann's Way
7178,between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still,Swann's Way
7178,"make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the",Swann's Way
7178,sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to,Swann's Way
7178,"come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his",Swann's Way
7178,"head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from",Swann's Way
7178,"a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and,",Swann's Way
7178,"having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us,",Swann's Way
7178,"with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least",Swann's Way
7178,"a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction",Swann's Way
7178,"of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise and the gardener, having 'made up'",Swann's Way
7178,"their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Don't you see, Françoise,"" he would say. ""Revolution would be better,",Swann's Way
7178,"because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop",Swann's Way
7178,all the railways.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes, to be sure; so that we sha'n't get away,"" said Françoise.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And the gardener would assent, with ""Ay, they're the cunning ones,"" for",Swann's Way
7178,he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the,Swann's Way
7178,"state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the",Swann's Way
7178,world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my",Swann's Way
7178,"book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to",Swann's Way
7178,"watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the",Swann's Way
7178,"passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored,",Swann's Way
7178,an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not,",Swann's Way
7178,"as a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would",Swann's Way
7178,"sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe,",Swann's Way
7178,like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual,Swann's Way
7178,"leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when",Swann's Way
7178,the sea itself has retreated.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read",Swann's Way
7178,"in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading,",Swann's Way
7178,"which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called",Swann's Way
7178,"Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards",Swann's Way
7178,"it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a",Swann's Way
7178,"wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I",Swann's Way
7178,would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older",Swann's Way
7178,"than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the",Swann's Way
7178,"name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he",Swann's Way
7178,"had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me,",Swann's Way
7178,"by way of warning: ""You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset,",Swann's Way
7178,"Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable",Swann's Way

7178,in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is,Swann's Way

7178,"two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who",Swann's Way
7178,"is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token,",Swann's Way
7178,"here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book",Swann's Way
7178,"recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so",Swann's Way
7178,"they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe,",Swann's Way
7178,"more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he",Swann's Way
7178,"exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering",Swann's Way
7178,"fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make",Swann's Way
7178,"allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic",Swann's Way
7178,"Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic",Swann's Way
7178,master-builder of rhythm who composed _Bhagavat_ and the _Lévrier de,Swann's Way

7178,"sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me,",Swann's Way
7178,"""my master."" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount",Swann's Way
7178,"of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one",Swann's Way
7178,believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with",Swann's Way
7178,"Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts",Swann's Way

7178,"which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of",Swann's Way
7178,"truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For,",Swann's Way
7178,"as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he",Swann's Way
7178,had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out,Swann's Way
7178,"that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and",Swann's Way
7178,"brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he",Swann's Way
7178,would not have objected on principle--indeed his own friend Swann was,Swann's Way
7178,of Jewish extraction--had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as,Swann's Way
7178,friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able,Swann's Way
7178,"to bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the ""O,",Swann's Way
7178,"God of our fathers"" from _La Juive_, or else ""Israel, break thy chain,""",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"  Archers, be on your guard!",Swann's Way
7178,"  Watch without rest, without sound,",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would",Swann's Way
7178,"call out ""On guard! on guard,"" or, if it were the victim himself who",Swann's Way
7178,"had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely",Swann's Way
7178,"look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will,Swann's Way
7178,whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for,Swann's Way
7178,"other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come",Swann's Way
7178,"in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I",Swann's Way
7178,"can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than ""Sir, I am",Swann's Way
7178,absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so,Swann's Way
7178,resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer,Swann's Way
7178,"trouble to inform me of them.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""My poor boy,"" said my father after Bloch had gone, ""your friend is out",Swann's Way
7178,"of his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As",Swann's Way
7178,"if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when",Swann's Way
7178,"she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped",Swann's Way
7178,the tears from his eyes.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You cannot imagine that he is sincere,"" she observed to me. ""Why he",Swann's Way
7178,"doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour,Swann's Way
7178,"and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and",Swann's Way
7178,"made not the least apology, saying merely: ""I never allow myself to be",Swann's Way
7178,influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or,Swann's Way
7178,by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly,Swann's Way
7178,"reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but",Swann's Way
7178,I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more,Swann's Way
7178,"pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the",Swann's Way
7178,"umbrella and the watch.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He,Swann's Way
7178,"was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for",Swann's Way
7178,"me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on",Swann's Way
7178,hearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they,Swann's Way
7178,"knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early",Swann's Way
7178,impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and,Swann's Way
7178,"the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty",Swann's Way
7178,"to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule",Swann's Way
7178,"of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly",Swann's Way
7178,"followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They",Swann's Way
7178,"would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would",Swann's Way
7178,"have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class",Swann's Way
7178,"morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly",Swann's Way
7178,"send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have",Swann's Way
7178,"thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of",Swann's Way
7178,"inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and",Swann's Way
7178,"emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were",Swann's Way
7178,as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries,Swann's Way
7178,we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us,Swann's Way
7178,"those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who,",Swann's Way
7178,"after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again,",Swann's Way
7178,yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the,Swann's Way
7178,"whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the",Swann's Way
7178,'proper thing' to do.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the,Swann's Way
7178,insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely,Swann's Way
7178,meaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë_ tired me more,Swann's Way
7178,and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with,Swann's Way
7178,"him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he",Swann's Way
7178,would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same,Swann's Way
7178,"night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a",Swann's Way
7178,"great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then",Swann's Way
7178,"more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that",Swann's Way
7178,"there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome,",Swann's Way
7178,he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable,Swann's Way
7178,authority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger,Swann's Way
7178,"days, and had been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing",Swann's Way
7178,on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time,Swann's Way
7178,"Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the",Swann's Way
7178,"street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head",Swann's Way
7178,"and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment",Swann's Way
7178,"'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style",Swann's Way
7178,"had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel",Swann's Way
7178,"of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the",Swann's Way
7178,"story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet",Swann's Way
7178,a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine,Swann's Way
7178,"it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic",Swann's Way
7178,"phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow",Swann's Way
7178,"of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would",Swann's Way
7178,"animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these,",Swann's Way
7178,"too, that he would begin to speak of the ""vain dream of life,"" of the",Swann's Way
7178,"""inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,"" of the ""sterile, splendid torture",Swann's Way
7178,"of understanding and loving,"" of the ""moving effigies which ennoble for",Swann's Way
7178,"all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals""; that he",Swann's Way
7178,"would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of",Swann's Way
7178,"marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have",Swann's Way
7178,"ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears,",Swann's Way
7178,an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and,Swann's Way
7178,"sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I",Swann's Way
7178,"had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy",Swann's Way
7178,"I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt",Swann's Way
7178,"myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep,",Swann's Way
7178,"undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to",Swann's Way
7178,"have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised",Swann's Way
7178,"in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts",Swann's Way
7178,"of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the",Swann's Way
7178,earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source,Swann's Way
7178,"of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted",Swann's Way
7178,"by a particular passage in one of Bergotte's works, which traced a",Swann's Way
7178,"purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but",Swann's Way
7178,"rather of the 'ideal passage' of Bergotte, common to every one of his",Swann's Way
7178,"books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming",Swann's Way
7178,"merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own",Swann's Way
7178,understanding seemed to be enlarged.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer,Swann's Way
7178,"also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du",Swann's Way
7178,Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's,Swann's Way
7178,"latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in",Swann's Way
7178,a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that,Swann's Way
7178,"taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally",Swann's Way
7178,acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe,Swann's Way
7178,"and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its",Swann's Way
7178,"refinement, but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would",Swann's Way
7178,"seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte",Swann's Way
7178,"was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned",Swann's Way
7178,"phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by",Swann's Way
7178,"him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on",Swann's Way
7178,"his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness,",Swann's Way
7178,"a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that",Swann's Way
7178,"these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had",Swann's Way
7178,"hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral,",Swann's Way
7178,"he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a",Swann's Way
7178,"lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in",Swann's Way
7178,"the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose,",Swann's Way
7178,"discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more",Swann's Way
7178,"delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when",Swann's Way
7178,the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the,Swann's Way
7178,"current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he",Swann's Way
7178,delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them,Swann's Way
7178,by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his,Swann's Way
7178,narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until,Swann's Way
7178,"then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of",Swann's Way
7178,"_Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or of _Phèdre_, by some piece",Swann's Way
7178,of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its,Swann's Way
7178,"essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable",Swann's Way
7178,"elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he",Swann's Way
7178,"not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion,",Swann's Way
7178,"some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon",Swann's Way
7178,"such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for",Swann's Way
7178,"myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the",Swann's Way
7178,"historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the",Swann's Way
7178,"emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he",Swann's Way
7178,"regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost",Swann's Way
7178,everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt,Swann's Way
7178,"that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an",Swann's Way
7178,unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced,Swann's Way
7178,that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected,Swann's Way
7178,"spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to",Swann's Way
7178,find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own,Swann's Way
7178,"mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity",Swann's Way
7178,"had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be",Swann's Way
7178,beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte,Swann's Way
7178,"would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when",Swann's Way
7178,"I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so",Swann's Way
7178,concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of,Swann's Way
7178,"mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later",Swann's Way
7178,"years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some",Swann's Way
7178,of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to,Swann's Way
7178,"go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences",Swann's Way
7178,"in Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages,",Swann's Way
7178,"that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in",Swann's Way
7178,my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have,Swann's Way
7178,"detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to",Swann's Way
7178,"life,' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of",Swann's Way
7178,"ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory",Swann's Way
7178,"attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came",Swann's Way
7178,"suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say",Swann's Way
7178,stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and,Swann's Way
7178,"self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite",Swann's Way
7178,"for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to",Swann's Way
7178,"prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And",Swann's Way
7178,"so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about",Swann's Way
7178,"an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a",Swann's Way
7178,"great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to",Swann's Way
7178,"my grandmother about Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered",Swann's Way
7178,that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of,Swann's Way
7178,"absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I",Swann's Way
7178,"had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my",Swann's Way
7178,remarks on Françoise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would,Swann's Way
7178,"most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief",Swann's Way
7178,that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly,Swann's Way
7178,revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were,Swann's Way
7178,"less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they",Swann's Way
7178,were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept,Swann's Way
7178,"upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and,Swann's Way
7178,"disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found",Swann's Way
7178,"any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in",Swann's Way
7178,"my brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself",Swann's Way
7178,"had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears",Swann's Way
7178,with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than,Swann's Way
7178,"anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged",Swann's Way
7178,myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the,Swann's Way
7178,age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called,Swann's Way
7178,"'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but",Swann's Way
7178,"simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and,",Swann's Way
7178,if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to,Swann's Way
7178,"follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by",Swann's Way
7178,"the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when",Swann's Way
7178,a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to,Swann's Way
7178,come.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, who had come to call upon my parents.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What are you reading? May I look? Why, it's Bergotte! Who has been",Swann's Way
7178,"telling you about him?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I replied that Bloch was responsible.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini",Swann's Way
7178,portrait of Mahomet II. It's an astonishing likeness; he has the same,Swann's Way
7178,arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard,Swann's Way
7178,"comes he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte",Swann's Way
7178,"is a charming creature."" And seeing how much I seemed to admire",Swann's Way
7178,"Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made",Swann's Way
7178,"an exception in my favour and said: ""I know him well; if you would like",Swann's Way
7178,him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him,Swann's Way
7178,"for you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions",Swann's Way
7178,"about his friend. ""Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the",Swann's Way
7178,stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have,Swann's Way
7178,"you seen her?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in _Phèdre_, in the _Cid_;",Swann's Way
7178,"well, she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't",Swann's Way
7178,"believe very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts."" As he spoke I",Swann's Way
7178,"noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with",Swann's Way
7178,"my grandmother's sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters,",Swann's Way
7178,whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion,Swann's Way
7178,"upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise",Swann's Way
7178,"it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he",Swann's Way
7178,"had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious",Swann's Way
7178,"to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say ""the",Swann's Way
7178,"'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly people call it."" But then, if it",Swann's Way
7178,"was so absurd, why did he say the 'hierarchy'? A moment later he went",Swann's Way
7178,"on: ""Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece",Swann's Way
7178,"of art in the world, as--oh, I don't know--"" and he began to laugh,",Swann's Way
7178,"""shall we say the Queens of Chartres?"" Until then I had supposed that",Swann's Way
7178,his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian,Swann's Way
7178,"and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's",Swann's Way
7178,sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the,Swann's Way
7178,"mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved,",Swann's Way
7178,"where, by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier",Swann's Way
7178,"generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise",Swann's Way
7178,"facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of",Swann's Way
7178,'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked,Swann's Way
7178,by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with,Swann's Way
7178,"generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and",Swann's Way
7178,"to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy,",Swann's Way
7178,some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take,Swann's Way
7178,"into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief",Swann's Way
7178,"(as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an",Swann's Way
7178,"importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I",Swann's Way
7178,"had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and",Swann's Way
7178,when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being,Swann's Way
7178,of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he,Swann's Way
7178,was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve,Swann's Way
7178,"the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things,",Swann's Way
7178,of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas;,Swann's Way
7178,and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at,Swann's Way
7178,"the same time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do",Swann's Way
7178,"him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that",Swann's Way
7178,"writer's admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and",Swann's Way
7178,"by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: ""He has a",Swann's Way
7178,"charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things,",Swann's Way
7178,"which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look",Swann's Way
7178,"for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once."" But",Swann's Way
7178,"none of them had yet gone so far as to say ""He is a great writer, he has",Swann's Way
7178,"great talent."" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They",Swann's Way
7178,"did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in",Swann's Way
7178,recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which,Swann's Way
7178,is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Simply,Swann's Way
7178,"because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no",Swann's Way
7178,resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather,Swann's Way
7178,"originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the",Swann's Way
7178,"sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?"" I asked",Swann's Way
7178,M. Swann.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of",Swann's Way
7178,"print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find",Swann's Way
7178,"out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next",Swann's Way
7178,"time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year's",Swann's Way
7178,end to another. He is my daughter's greatest friend. They go about,Swann's Way
7178,"together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social,Swann's Way
7178,"hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see",Swann's Way
7178,"anything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the",Swann's Way
7178,contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an,Swann's Way
7178,"enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in",Swann's Way
7178,my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her,Swann's Way
7178,"lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to",Swann's Way
7178,"her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on",Swann's Way
7178,"account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and",Swann's Way
7178,"one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same",Swann's Way
7178,"features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily,",Swann's Way
7178,"but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned",Swann's Way
7178,that Mlle. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate,Swann's Way
7178,"circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of",Swann's Way
7178,"privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming",Swann's Way
7178,"to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with",Swann's Way
7178,"celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to",Swann's Way
7178,"her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the",Swann's Way
7178,"intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those",Swann's Way
7178,"subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on",Swann's Way
7178,"which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all,",Swann's Way
7178,"when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side,",Swann's Way
7178,"unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from",Swann's Way
7178,heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth,Swann's Way
7178,"of a creature such as Mlle. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and",Swann's Way
7178,ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and,Swann's Way
7178,yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was,Swann's Way
7178,"filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this",Swann's Way
7178,"time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the",Swann's Way
7178,"porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant,",Swann's Way
7178,"and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as",Swann's Way
7178,"her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies",Swann's Way
7178,"which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the",Swann's Way
7178,"hills and valleys of the Ile-de-France and of the plains of Normandy,",Swann's Way
7178,would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my,Swann's Way
7178,mind of Mlle. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love,Swann's Way
7178,her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown,Swann's Way
7178,existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us,Swann's Way
7178,"admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts,",Swann's Way
7178,"the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him",Swann's Way
7178,generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend,Swann's Way
7178,"that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an",Swann's Way
7178,emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall,Swann's Way
7178,"in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less",Swann's Way
7178,particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the,Swann's Way
7178,"crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more",Swann's Way
7178,"gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king",Swann's Way
7178,or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most,Swann's Way
7178,"gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic",Swann's Way
7178,"profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never",Swann's Way

7178,which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce,Swann's Way
7178,"his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her",Swann's Way
7178,"invalid. The Curé (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did",Swann's Way
7178,"not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts,",Swann's Way

7178,"am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I",Swann's Way

7178,"Percepied's brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that",Swann's Way

7178,"to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in",Swann's Way
7178,the famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most,Swann's Way
7178,"active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if",Swann's Way
7178,"you don't wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off",Swann's Way
7178,the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped,Swann's Way
7178,"up,"" he went on, without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion",Swann's Way
7178,"that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry,",Swann's Way
7178,"""for there's a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people",Swann's Way
7178,even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No,Swann's Way
7178,"matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come,",Swann's Way
7178,"some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they",Swann's Way
7178,"always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you",Swann's Way
7178,"will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must",Swann's Way
7178,"admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with",Swann's Way
7178,"what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special",Swann's Way
7178,charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And,Swann's Way
7178,then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in,Swann's Way
7178,"the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course",Swann's Way
7178,"of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-lès-Combray, which",Swann's Way
7178,"are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another",Swann's Way
7178,"example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is",Swann's Way
7178,"_Gaudiacus vicecomitis_, as of course you know. Each time that I have",Swann's Way
7178,"been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have",Swann's Way
7178,"turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no",Swann's Way
7178,longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one,Swann's Way
7178,"another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite",Swann's Way
7178,another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a,Swann's Way
7178,"map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were",Swann's Way
7178,"great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a",Swann's Way
7178,loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To,Swann's Way
7178,get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up,Swann's Way
7178,"here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The Curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than,Swann's Way
7178,she was obliged to send away Eulalie also.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Here, my poor Eulalie,"" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from",Swann's Way
7178,"a small purse which lay ready to her hand. ""This is just something so",Swann's Way
7178,"that you shall not forget me in your prayers.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well",Swann's Way
7178,"that I don't come here for that!"" So Eulalie would answer, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though",Swann's Way
7178,"each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which",Swann's Way
7178,"enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that",Swann's Way
7178,"Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual,",Swann's Way
7178,"my aunt would remark afterwards, ""I cannot think what has come over",Swann's Way
7178,"Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look",Swann's Way
7178,"at all pleased.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,""",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty",Swann's Way
7178,"cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as",Swann's Way
7178,treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the,Swann's Way
7178,"little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so",Swann's Way
7178,discreetly passed that Françoise never managed to see them. It was,Swann's Way
7178,not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed,Swann's Way
7178,on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my,Swann's Way
7178,"aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress",Swann's Way
7178,automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world;,Swann's Way
7178,and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my",Swann's Way
7178,"aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Curé, and",Swann's Way
7178,the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed.,Swann's Way
7178,Françoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over,Swann's Way
7178,my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest,Swann's Way
7178,ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with,Swann's Way
7178,"a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what",Swann's Way
7178,"my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give",Swann's Way
7178,"away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's",Swann's Way
7178,"presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on",Swann's Way
7178,"that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and",Swann's Way
7178,"position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil,",Swann's Way
7178,"to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally",Swann's Way
7178,"'mix with her,' seemed to Françoise to be included among the ornamental",Swann's Way
7178,"customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who",Swann's Way
7178,"hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would",Swann's Way
7178,contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same,Swann's Way
7178,"thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted",Swann's Way
7178,"mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Françoise",Swann's Way
7178,"would label ""people like myself,"" or ""people no better than myself,""",Swann's Way
7178,people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always,Swann's Way
7178,"as ""Mme. Françoise,"" just to shew that they considered themselves to be",Swann's Way
7178,"'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt",Swann's Way
7178,"continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with",Swann's Way
7178,"both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on undeserving objects,",Swann's Way
7178,she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt,Swann's Way
7178,were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon,Swann's Way
7178,"Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such",Swann's Way
7178,prosperity and importance that Françoise doubted Eulalie's ability to,Swann's Way
7178,"buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to",Swann's Way
7178,my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an,Swann's Way
7178,exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Françoise.,Swann's Way
7178,"So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would mercilessly",Swann's Way
7178,"prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same",Swann's Way
7178,"time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to 'look",Swann's Way
7178,pleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's departure;,Swann's Way
7178,"never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in",Swann's Way
7178,"Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like",Swann's Way
7178,"those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special",Swann's Way
7178,application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of,Swann's Way
7178,the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her;,Swann's Way
7178,"""Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the",Swann's Way
7178,"crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and",Swann's Way
7178,"one fine day He will be avenged upon them!"" she would declaim, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when",Swann's Way
7178,he says that the,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,            ....prosperity,Swann's Way
7178,"  Of wicked men runs like a torrent past,",Swann's Way
7178,  And soon is spent.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But on this memorable afternoon, when the Curé had come as well, and",Swann's Way
7178,"by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, Françoise",Swann's Way
7178,"followed Eulalie from the room, saying: ""Mme. Octave, I will leave you",Swann's Way
7178,"to rest; you look utterly tired out.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that",Swann's Way
7178,"it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though already dead. But hardly had Françoise arrived downstairs, when",Swann's Way
7178,"four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated",Swann's Way
7178,"through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out:",Swann's Way
7178,"""Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her,",Swann's Way
7178,"quick!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But Françoise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. ""It",Swann's Way
7178,"is most provoking,"" said my aunt, shaking her head. ""The one important",Swann's Way
7178,"thing that I had to ask her.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In this way life went by for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation",Swann's Way
7178,"but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all",Swann's Way
7178,"and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having",Swann's Way
7178,"learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had",Swann's Way
7178,"become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well,",Swann's Way
7178,"where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a",Swann's Way
7178,packing-case would send first to Françoise to make sure that my aunt,Swann's Way
7178,"was not 'resting'--her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally",Swann's Way
7178,disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among,Swann's Way
7178,"its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it",Swann's Way
7178,"falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's",Swann's Way
7178,"confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife",Swann's Way
7178,"in Combray, Françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from",Swann's Way
7178,"Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl,",Swann's Way
7178,"and as Françoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in",Swann's Way
7178,"returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of",Swann's Way
7178,"the morning, my mother said to me: ""Run upstairs, and see if your aunt",Swann's Way
7178,"wants anything.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the",Swann's Way
7178,"other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,",Swann's Way
7178,in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip,Swann's Way
7178,"away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her",Swann's Way
7178,"sleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays,",Swann's Way
7178,for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a,Swann's Way
7178,"lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see",Swann's Way
7178,for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she,Swann's Way
7178,had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from,Swann's Way
7178,"where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go",Swann's Way
7178,forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense,Swann's Way
7178,"of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified",Swann's Way
7178,"her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased",Swann's Way
7178,"to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined",Swann's Way
7178,"her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself,",Swann's Way
7178,"half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: ""The Lord be",Swann's Way
7178,praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby.,Swann's Way
7178,"And I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and",Swann's Way
7178,"was trying to make me take a walk every day!"" She stretched out a hand",Swann's Way
7178,"towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was",Swann's Way
7178,"once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to",Swann's Way
7178,"reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the",Swann's Way
7178,"room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from",Swann's Way
7178,"that day to this, what I had seen and heard.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my",Swann's Way
7178,"aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include",Swann's Way
7178,"those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical",Swann's Way
7178,"form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,",Swann's Way
7178,the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my,Swann's Way
7178,aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to,Swann's Way
7178,"her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She",Swann's Way
7178,"was so well 'routined' to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a",Swann's Way
7178,"Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour,",Swann's Way
7178,"it would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary",Swann's Way
7178,"day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this",Swann's Way
7178,"acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual",Swann's Way
7178,"character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily,",Swann's Way
7178,"there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded,",Swann's Way
7178,we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives,Swann's Way
7178,"make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an",Swann's Way
7178,"omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday",Swann's Way
7178,"was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost",Swann's Way
7178,"civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a",Swann's Way
7178,"kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation,",Swann's Way
7178,"for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator",Swann's Way
7178,"pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary",Swann's Way
7178,"cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were",Swann's Way
7178,"dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the",Swann's Way
7178,"strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly,",Swann's Way
7178,"cordially, patriotically, ""Hurry up; there's no time to be lost; don't",Swann's Way
7178,"forget, it's Saturday!"" while my aunt, gossiping with Françoise, and",Swann's Way
7178,"reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, ""You",Swann's Way
7178,"might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it's Saturday."" If, at",Swann's Way
7178,"half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,"" everyone else would",Swann's Way
7178,"be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: ""Why, what are you",Swann's Way
7178,"thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's Saturday?"" And a quarter",Swann's Way
7178,"of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to",Swann's Way
7178,"go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The",Swann's Way
7178,very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the,Swann's Way
7178,"sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the",Swann's Way
7178,"zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for",Swann's Way
7178,"our walk, said, ""What, only two o'clock!"" feeling the heavy throb go by",Swann's Way
7178,him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as,Swann's Way
7178,"a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the",Swann's Way
7178,"midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the",Swann's Way
7178,"bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and",Swann's Way
7178,"so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering",Swann's Way
7178,clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus:,Swann's Way
7178,"""Why, you're forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very",Swann's Way
7178,"well it's Saturday.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The surprise of a 'barbarian' (for so we termed everyone who was not,Swann's Way
7178,acquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at eleven,Swann's Way
7178,"o'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event",Swann's Way
7178,"which used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything",Swann's Way
7178,that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the,Swann's Way
7178,"nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our",Swann's Way
7178,"luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly",Swann's Way
7178,"funny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom",Swann's Way
7178,"of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never",Swann's Way
7178,have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a,Swann's Way
7178,"matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the",Swann's Way
7178,"other's surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: ""You see, it's",Swann's Way
7178,"Saturday."" On reaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to",Swann's Way
7178,"wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own",Swann's Way
7178,"enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for",Swann's Way
7178,the visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far,Swann's Way
7178,"from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story",Swann's Way
7178,"was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: ""Oh, but surely he",Swann's Way
7178,"said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time",Swann's Way
7178,"you told it.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and",Swann's Way
7178,look on at us over her glasses.,Swann's Way

7178,"The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May",Swann's Way
7178,we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the 'Month of,Swann's Way
7178,Mary' devotions.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict",Swann's Way
7178,"views on ""the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to",Swann's Way
7178,"be encouraged in these days,"" my mother would first see that there was",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for",Swann's Way
7178,the church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember,Swann's Way
7178,having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not,Swann's Way
7178,"merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us",Swann's Way
7178,"a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from",Swann's Way
7178,"the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in",Swann's Way
7178,"among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to",Swann's Way
7178,"one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and",Swann's Way
7178,they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark,Swann's Way
7178,"leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train,",Swann's Way
7178,little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look,Swann's Way
7178,"at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme",Swann's Way
7178,"was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by",Swann's Way
7178,"trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament",Swann's Way
7178,"of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at",Swann's Way
7178,"once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar,",Swann's Way
7178,"a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so",Swann's Way
7178,"unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of",Swann's Way
7178,"stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a",Swann's Way
7178,"white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate,",Swann's Way
7178,"somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it",Swann's Way
7178,as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance,Swann's Way

7178,"prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, who had made what he called ""a most unsuitable marriage, as",Swann's Way
7178,"seems to be the fashion in these days."" My mother, on hearing that he",Swann's Way
7178,"'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see",Swann's Way
7178,"him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others",Swann's Way
7178,"to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was",Swann's Way
7178,"afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out,",Swann's Way
7178,or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day,Swann's Way
7178,"when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them,",Swann's Way
7178,"but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil's house,",Swann's Way
7178,"Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill",Swann's Way
7178,"covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a",Swann's Way
7178,"level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its",Swann's Way
7178,"window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived,",Swann's Way
7178,I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music,Swann's Way
7178,so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had,Swann's Way
7178,"snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of",Swann's Way
7178,letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave,Swann's Way
7178,him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time,Swann's Way
7178,"that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject",Swann's Way
7178,"of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: ""I cannot think who put that",Swann's Way
7178,"on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,"" and had turned",Swann's Way
7178,"the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of",Swann's Way
7178,less interest to himself.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her",Swann's Way
7178,"somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to",Swann's Way
7178,restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take,Swann's Way
7178,"for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around",Swann's Way
7178,"her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle,",Swann's Way
7178,"delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting",Swann's Way
7178,"across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid",Swann's Way
7178,"child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the",Swann's Way
7178,"sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed",Swann's Way
7178,"at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear",Swann's Way
7178,"outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the",Swann's Way
7178,"'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before",Swann's Way
7178,"the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of",Swann's Way
7178,"almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed",Swann's Way
7178,"that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour,",Swann's Way
7178,"in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste",Swann's Way
7178,"of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mlle.",Swann's Way
7178,"Vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless",Swann's Way
7178,"silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like",Swann's Way
7178,"the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was",Swann's Way
7178,"quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I",Swann's Way
7178,"was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed",Swann's Way
7178,"to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging",Swann's Way
7178,insects now transmuted into flowers.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil,",Swann's Way
7178,"in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he",Swann's Way
7178,"would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the",Swann's Way
7178,"big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she",Swann's Way
7178,"had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and",Swann's Way
7178,"more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,",Swann's Way
7178,"schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was",Swann's Way
7178,angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange,Swann's Way
7178,"a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart",Swann's Way
7178,"which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain.",Swann's Way
7178,"As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and",Swann's Way
7178,"stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then,",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal",Swann's Way
7178,"distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my",Swann's Way
7178,"mother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing",Swann's Way
7178,"which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his",Swann's Way
7178,"strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which",Swann's Way
7178,"began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and",Swann's Way
7178,to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of,Swann's Way
7178,"civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would",Swann's Way
7178,"be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss",Swann's Way
7178,"the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start",Swann's Way
7178,"again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of",Swann's Way
7178,"Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit.",Swann's Way
7178,"We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most",Swann's Way
7178,"attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight,",Swann's Way
7178,"copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases",Swann's Way
7178,"of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its",Swann's Way
7178,beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was,Swann's Way
7178,"a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which",Swann's Way
7178,"endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and",Swann's Way
7178,ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a,Swann's Way
7178,consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering,Swann's Way
7178,"and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart",Swann's Way
7178,"the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up",Swann's Way
7178,"an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray",Swann's Way
7178,were constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must,Swann's Way
7178,"have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their",Swann's Way
7178,"alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its",Swann's Way
7178,"lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my,Swann's Way
7178,"mother--""Where are we?"" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of",Swann's Way
7178,"her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least",Swann's Way
7178,"idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had",Swann's Way
7178,"slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point",Swann's Way
7178,"out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own",Swann's Way
7178,"garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings",Swann's Way
7178,"over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly ""You really are",Swann's Way
7178,"wonderful!"" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the",Swann's Way
7178,"ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long,",Swann's Way
7178,"my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my",Swann's Way
7178,"will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to",Swann's Way
7178,"my bed, and laid me down there like a little child.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her",Swann's Way
7178,"of the services of Françoise, passed more slowly than other days for my",Swann's Way
7178,"aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look",Swann's Way
7178,"forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all",Swann's Way
7178,the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was,Swann's Way
7178,"still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not",Swann's Way
7178,"long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not",Swann's Way
7178,pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something,Swann's Way
7178,"different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of",Swann's Way
7178,"energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in",Swann's Way
7178,"their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion",Swann's Way
7178,"(even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has",Swann's Way
7178,"silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again",Swann's Way
7178,"by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when",Swann's Way
7178,"the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its",Swann's Way
7178,"impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled",Swann's Way
7178,"desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins",Swann's Way
7178,"into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of",Swann's Way
7178,"course, since my aunt's strength, which was completely drained by the",Swann's Way
7178,"slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her",Swann's Way
7178,"repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by",Swann's Way
7178,before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily,Swann's Way
7178,"activities, but which she had no idea--and could never decide how to",Swann's Way
7178,employ. And I have no doubt that then--just as a desire to have her,Swann's Way
7178,"potatoes served with béchamel sauce, for a change, would be formed,",Swann's Way
7178,"ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of",Swann's Way
7178,those mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired'--she would extract,Swann's Way
7178,from the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much,Swann's Way
7178,"depended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous",Swann's Way
7178,"in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect,",Swann's Way
7178,"once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to",Swann's Way
7178,"her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some",Swann's Way
7178,such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the,Swann's Way
7178,long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when,Swann's Way
7178,"she felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house",Swann's Way
7178,"was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already",Swann's Way
7178,"perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone",Swann's Way
7178,"standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have",Swann's Way
7178,"plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose",Swann's Way
7178,"at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect",Swann's Way
7178,which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the,Swann's Way
7178,"full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of",Swann's Way
7178,causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally,Swann's Way
7178,"forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but",Swann's Way
7178,"erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to",Swann's Way
7178,"go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where",Swann's Way
7178,there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever,Swann's Way
7178,"occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of",Swann's Way
7178,such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of,Swann's Way
7178,patience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first,Swann's Way
7178,"moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen",Swann's Way
7178,"facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never",Swann's Way
7178,"afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it",Swann's Way
7178,"the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the",Swann's Way
7178,logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time,Swann's Way
7178,"to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor",Swann's Way
7178,"catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile",Swann's Way
7178,"herself with a sudden suspicion that Françoise had been robbing her,",Swann's Way
7178,"that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer",Swann's Way
7178,"red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by",Swann's Way
7178,"herself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would",Swann's Way
7178,"first stammer out Françoise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them",Swann's Way
7178,with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude,Swann's Way
7178,"upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration,",Swann's Way
7178,"her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness",Swann's Way
7178,"of her brows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these",Swann's Way
7178,"mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words",Swann's Way
7178,"would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been",Swann's Way
7178,"allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree",Swann's Way
7178,of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them,Swann's Way
7178,"half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not",Swann's Way
7178,"satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday,",Swann's Way
7178,"with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her",Swann's Way
7178,"doubts of Françoise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her,",Swann's Way
7178,and on another day she would confide in Françoise her suspicions of the,Swann's Way
7178,"disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed",Swann's Way
7178,"for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she",Swann's Way
7178,"would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the",Swann's Way
7178,"next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But",Swann's Way
7178,the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no,Swann's Way
7178,"more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel,",Swann's Way
7178,since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very,Swann's Way
7178,"different matter when the suspect was Françoise, of whose presence under",Swann's Way
7178,"the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for",Swann's Way
7178,"fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare",Swann's Way
7178,"go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was,",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until",Swann's Way
7178,"her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the",Swann's Way
7178,"day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her",Swann's Way
7178,by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Françoise's,Swann's Way
7178,"features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire",Swann's Way
7178,which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was,Swann's Way
7178,"unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise turn pale, and which",Swann's Way
7178,my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy,Swann's Way
7178,servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie--like,Swann's Way
7178,one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field,Swann's Way
7178,for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only,Swann's Way
7178,the beaten paths--proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell,Swann's Way
7178,"a long way short of the appalling truth. ""But Françoise ought to know",Swann's Way
7178,"that,"" said Eulalie, ""now that you have given her a carriage.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Now that I have given her a carriage!"" gasped my aunt.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in",Swann's Way
7178,"her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market.",Swann's Way
7178,"I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the",Swann's Way
7178,"hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices.",Swann's Way
7178,My mother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of,Swann's Way
7178,"my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However",Swann's Way
7178,"that might be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely",Swann's Way
7178,scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had,Swann's Way
7178,"to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time,",Swann's Way
7178,making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her,Swann's Way
7178,"request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the",Swann's Way
7178,"expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply.",Swann's Way
7178,And in this way--whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the,Swann's Way
7178,"seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great",Swann's Way
7178,"Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when",Swann's Way
7178,he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic,Swann's Way
7178,"family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning",Swann's Way
7178,"Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was",Swann's Way
7178,making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore,Swann's Way
7178,lifeless copy of mere outward forms--a middle-aged lady in a small,Swann's Way
7178,"country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her",Swann's Way
7178,"own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered",Swann's Way
7178,"by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having",Swann's Way
7178,"given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily",Swann's Way
7178,"life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by",Swann's Way
7178,"virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was",Swann's Way
7178,to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at,Swann's Way
7178,"Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence,",Swann's Way
7178,a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features would provide,Swann's Way
7178,Françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and,Swann's Way
7178,"terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King",Swann's Way
7178,"when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition",Swann's Way
7178,"to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé",Swann's Way
7178,"and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the",Swann's Way
7178,"whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured",Swann's Way
7178,to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both,Swann's Way
7178,visitors to her door at the same time.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,"" she said kindly,",Swann's Way
7178,"""you have had all your friends here at once.""",Swann's Way

7178,far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of,Swann's Way
7178,things. But my father had begun to speak.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I should like to take advantage,"" he said, ""of the whole family's being",Swann's Way
7178,"here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over",Swann's Way
7178,again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's,Swann's Way

7178,"downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,",Swann's Way
7178,"which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and",Swann's Way

7178,"walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the",Swann's Way
7178,"neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in",Swann's Way
7178,"a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M.",Swann's Way
7178,"Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of",Swann's Way

7178,known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being,Swann's Way
7178,"out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father",Swann's Way
7178,asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,"" he",Swann's Way
7178,"said, ""because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there",Swann's Way
7178,"is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft",Swann's Way
7178,"neckties, so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of",Swann's Way
7178,"innocence, almost, which is really attractive.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my",Swann's Way
7178,father's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening.,Swann's Way
7178,"As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin",Swann's Way
7178,"himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more",Swann's Way
7178,"in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: ""Do you know,",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have,Swann's Way

7178,"his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon.",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was,Swann's Way
7178,"for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise,",Swann's Way
7178,"a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the",Swann's Way
7178,"fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be",Swann's Way
7178,"stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had",Swann's Way
7178,"been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of",Swann's Way
7178,"the potter's craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons",Swann's Way
7178,"and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny",Swann's Way
7178,"pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and",Swann's Way
7178,"pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the",Swann's Way
7178,"kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up",Swann's Way
7178,"in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but",Swann's Way
7178,"what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine",Swann's Way
7178,"and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and",Swann's Way
7178,"azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white",Swann's Way
7178,"feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a",Swann's Way
7178,rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these,Swann's Way
7178,celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had,Swann's Way
7178,"been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which",Swann's Way
7178,"covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this",Swann's Way
7178,"radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening",Swann's Way
7178,"shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all",Swann's Way
7178,"night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played",Swann's Way
7178,(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's,Swann's Way
7178,_Dream_) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic,Swann's Way
7178,perfume.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with",Swann's Way
7178,"the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside",Swann's Way
7178,"her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows",Swann's Way
7178,of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which,Swann's Way
7178,capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and,Swann's Way
7178,"separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers",Swann's Way
7178,"banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua.",Swann's Way
7178,"And, meanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those",Swann's Way
7178,"chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted",Swann's Way
7178,"far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while",Swann's Way
7178,"she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness",Swann's Way
7178,predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character;,Swann's Way
7178,"the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous",Swann's Way
7178,"and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of",Swann's Way
7178,her many virtues.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon",Swann's Way
7178,"our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one",Swann's Way
7178,"of those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her",Swann's Way
7178,"recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise,",Swann's Way
7178,"being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw",Swann's Way
7178,"her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of",Swann's Way
7178,"killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of ""Filthy creature!",Swann's Way
7178,"Filthy creature!"" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our",Swann's Way
7178,"servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when",Swann's Way
7178,"it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and",Swann's Way
7178,its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it,Swann's Way
7178,"was dead Françoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however,",Swann's Way
7178,"she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst",Swann's Way
7178,"of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final",Swann's Way
7178,"""Filthy creature!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could",Swann's Way
7178,"have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who",Swann's Way
7178,"would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and",Swann's Way
7178,"even--roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had",Swann's Way
7178,already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew,Swann's Way
7178,"(though I was still in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her",Swann's Way
7178,"own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a",Swann's Way
7178,"murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest",Swann's Way
7178,"of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while",Swann's Way
7178,"conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began",Swann's Way
7178,"gradually to realise that Françoise's kindness, her compunction, the",Swann's Way
7178,"sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies,",Swann's Way
7178,just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens,Swann's Way
7178,who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of,Swann's Way
7178,"churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of",Swann's Way
7178,"the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity",Swann's Way
7178,inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance,Swann's Way
7178,separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her,Swann's Way
7178,"in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her,",Swann's Way
7178,"in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a",Swann's Way
7178,"more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after",Swann's Way
7178,"her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling",Swann's Way
7178,"pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Françoise, who,",Swann's Way
7178,"quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that",Swann's Way
7178,"the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house. The doctor, who",Swann's Way
7178,"had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical",Swann's Way
7178,"dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were",Swann's Way
7178,"described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find",Swann's Way
7178,the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent Françoise,Swann's Way
7178,"to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour",Swann's Way
7178,"elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that",Swann's Way
7178,"she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the",Swann's Way
7178,"bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who,",Swann's Way
7178,"in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read",Swann's Way
7178,"the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing,",Swann's Way
7178,now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not,Swann's Way
7178,familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would,Swann's Way
7178,"exclaim: ""Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any",Swann's Way
7178,"wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of",Swann's Way
7178,"Giotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no",Swann's Way
7178,stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she,Swann's Way
7178,"very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal",Swann's Way
7178,of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of,Swann's Way
7178,weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of,Swann's Way
7178,the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very,Swann's Way
7178,"sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she",Swann's Way
7178,"had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter",Swann's Way
7178,"sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot:",Swann's Way
7178,"""Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all",Swann's Way
7178,"this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better",Swann's Way
7178,"not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would set",Swann's Way
7178,"off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to",Swann's Way
7178,"see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot",Swann's Way
7178,"before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love",Swann's Way
7178,"for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of",Swann's Way
7178,"her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to",Swann's Way
7178,"the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any",Swann's Way
7178,of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride,Swann's Way
7178,"in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she",Swann's Way
7178,"herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in",Swann's Way
7178,"person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry",Swann's Way
7178,"into her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera,",Swann's Way
7178,"observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a",Swann's Way
7178,"supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls",Swann's Way
7178,in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive,Swann's Way
7178,"cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds",Swann's Way
7178,with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which,Swann's Way
7178,their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions),Swann's Way
7178,"depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid,",Swann's Way
7178,"will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive",Swann's Way
7178,"quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh",Swann's Way
7178,"for the larder: in the same way Françoise had adopted, to minister",Swann's Way
7178,to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house,Swann's Way
7178,"uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless",Swann's Way
7178,"stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on",Swann's Way
7178,"asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the",Swann's Way
7178,"smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them,",Swann's Way
7178,such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my,Swann's Way
7178,aunt's service.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one,Swann's Way
7178,"of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after",Swann's Way
7178,"which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass",Swann's Way
7178,"drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world,",Swann's Way
7178,"something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when",Swann's Way
7178,"I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed",Swann's Way
7178,"on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen",Swann's Way
7178,"me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little",Swann's Way
7178,kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in,Swann's Way
7178,"loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the",Swann's Way
7178,"sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the",Swann's Way
7178,"market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with",Swann's Way
7178,"him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife",Swann's Way
7178,of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face,Swann's Way
7178,"shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with",Swann's Way
7178,a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a,Swann's Way
7178,"position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have",Swann's Way
7178,"been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid",Swann's Way
7178,recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's,Swann's Way
7178,"hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but",Swann's Way
7178,"this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the",Swann's Way
7178,"least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury",Swann's Way
7178,"by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke",Swann's Way
7178,my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different,Swann's Way
7178,from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her,Swann's Way
7178,"coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression",Swann's Way
7178,"of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there,",Swann's Way
7178,"still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled,",Swann's Way
7178,then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than,Swann's Way
7178,"usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left,",Swann's Way
7178,"in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he",Swann's Way
7178,"abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he",Swann's Way
7178,were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile,Swann's Way
7178,we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him;,Swann's Way
7178,"he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which",Swann's Way
7178,"had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his",Swann's Way
7178,"vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us,",Swann's Way
7178,"and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with",Swann's Way
7178,"an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked",Swann's Way
7178,"as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself,",Swann's Way
7178,and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted,Swann's Way
7178,"necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in",Swann's Way
7178,"front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his",Swann's Way
7178,noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered,Swann's Way
7178,"that we had forgotten the 'Saint-Honoré,' and asked my father to go",Swann's Way
7178,back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met,Swann's Way
7178,"Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting",Swann's Way
7178,"to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was",Swann's Way
7178,"saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little",Swann's Way
7178,"sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as",Swann's Way
7178,"it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to",Swann's Way
7178,"pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the",Swann's Way
7178,intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which,Swann's Way
7178,"they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set",Swann's Way
7178,"apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went",Swann's Way
7178,"far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of",Swann's Way
7178,roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink,Swann's Way
7178,"of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the",Swann's Way
7178,"mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances",Swann's Way
7178,"of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a",Swann's Way
7178,"declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret",Swann's Way
7178,"and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an",Swann's Way
7178,enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.,Swann's Way

7178,Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him,Swann's Way
7178,"on this same Sunday evening. ""Come and bear your aged friend company,""",Swann's Way

7178,"closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought",Swann's Way
7178,still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused,Swann's Way
7178,to believe that he could have been impolite.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply",Swann's Way
7178,"dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion."" She added",Swann's Way
7178,"that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally",Swann's Way
7178,"rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing.",Swann's Way
7178,"And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the",Swann's Way
7178,"attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a",Swann's Way
7178,final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude,Swann's Way
7178,or action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character; they bear,Swann's Way
7178,"no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our",Swann's Way
7178,"suspicions by the culprit's evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are",Swann's Way
7178,"reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether",Swann's Way
7178,indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said,",Swann's Way

7178,"I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I",Swann's Way
7178,knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local,Swann's Way
7178,"aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I",Swann's Way
7178,"summoned up all my courage and said to him: ""Tell me, sir, do you, by",Swann's Way
7178,"any chance, know the lady--the ladies of Guermantes?"" and I felt glad",Swann's Way
7178,"because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over",Swann's Way

7178,"been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils,",Swann's Way
7178,"reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow.",Swann's Way
7178,"His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been",Swann's Way
7178,"stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and",Swann's Way
7178,"smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a",Swann's Way
7178,good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, I do not know them,"" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a",Swann's Way
7178,"piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could",Swann's Way
7178,"astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have",Swann's Way
7178,"befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word,",Swann's Way
7178,"leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man",Swann's Way
7178,"gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though",Swann's Way
7178,the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some,Swann's Way
7178,"strange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding",Swann's Way
7178,"himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation,",Swann's Way
7178,"chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the",Swann's Way
7178,"confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is",Swann's Way
7178,"easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this",Swann's Way
7178,"case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very",Swann's Way
7178,"well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin",Swann's Way
7178,"himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or",Swann's Way
7178,mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No,"" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were",Swann's Way
7178,"uttered. ""No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I",Swann's Way

7178,"make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that's not the",Swann's Way
7178,sort of reputation that can frighten me; it's too true! In my heart,Swann's Way

7178,"enough, now, to distinguish.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going",Swann's Way
7178,"to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to",Swann's Way
7178,"cling to one's independence, nor how that could give one the appearance",Swann's Way
7178,"of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that",Swann's Way
7178,Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only,Swann's Way
7178,"for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very",Swann's Way
7178,"great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much",Swann's Way
7178,"afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he",Swann's Way
7178,"would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among",Swann's Way
7178,"his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and",Swann's Way
7178,"stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should",Swann's Way
7178,"be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment",Swann's Way
7178,"should go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a",Swann's Way
7178,snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the,Swann's Way
7178,poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked,Swann's Way
7178,"him, ""Do you know the Guermantes family?"" Legrandin the talker would",Swann's Way
7178,"reply, ""No, I have never cared to know them."" But unfortunately the",Swann's Way
7178,"talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully",Swann's Way
7178,"hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because",Swann's Way
7178,this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his,Swann's Way
7178,snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this,Swann's Way
7178,"other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that",Swann's Way
7178,"stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those",Swann's Way
7178,"few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had",Swann's Way
7178,"instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of",Swann's Way
7178,snobbery:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not",Swann's Way
7178,"remind me of the great sorrow of my life."" And since this other,",Swann's Way
7178,"this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our",Swann's Way
7178,"Legrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness",Swann's Way
7178,"in expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it",Swann's Way
7178,"followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he",Swann's Way
7178,"would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to",Swann's Way
7178,deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his _alter ego_ must,Swann's Way
7178,"have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate",Swann's Way
7178,them.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he,Swann's Way
7178,"inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least)",Swann's Way
7178,"be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of",Swann's Way
7178,"others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out",Swann's Way
7178,about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon,Swann's Way
7178,"ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which",Swann's Way
7178,"substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives,",Swann's Way
7178,less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness,Swann's Way
7178,"impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it",Swann's Way
7178,"would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the",Swann's Way
7178,"duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the",Swann's Way
7178,"attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of",Swann's Way
7178,snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was,Swann's Way
7178,"of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the",Swann's Way
7178,"intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition",Swann's Way
7178,the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin,",Swann's Way
7178,and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be,Swann's Way
7178,"greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which",Swann's Way
7178,"he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my",Swann's Way
7178,"father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in",Swann's Way
7178,"so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending",Swann's Way
7178,"me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother,",Swann's Way
7178,"he said: ""I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to",Swann's Way
7178,"Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister.",Swann's Way

7178,"that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties",Swann's Way
7178,"and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights,",Swann's Way
7178,"to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our",Swann's Way
7178,"plans; for already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just",Swann's Way
7178,"as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain",Swann's Way
7178,indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to,Swann's Way
7178,"scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and",Swann's Way
7178,that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with,Swann's Way
7178,"his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to",Swann's Way
7178,"introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who,",Swann's Way
7178,without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of,Swann's Way
7178,"visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when",Swann's Way
7178,we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which",Swann's Way
7178,"are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?"" he said to my father.",Swann's Way
7178,"""Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a",Swann's Way

7178,"being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking",Swann's Way
7178,"of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these",Swann's Way

7178,"to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality",Swann's Way

7178,futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself;,Swann's Way

7178,"poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of",Swann's Way

7178,"fly upstairs to my aunt Léonie's room to reassure her, to prove to her",Swann's Way
7178,"by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that,",Swann's Way
7178,"on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the",Swann's Way
7178,"'Guermantes way,' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew",Swann's Way
7178,well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""There, Françoise,"" my aunt would say, ""didn't I tell you that they must",Swann's Way
7178,have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And,Swann's Way
7178,"your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours",Swann's Way
7178,"it's been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes way?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,"" Mamma would answer. ""I thought",Swann's Way
7178,"that Françoise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the",Swann's Way
7178,"kitchen-garden.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For there were, in the environs of Combray, two 'ways' which we used to",Swann's Way
7178,"take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually",Swann's Way
7178,"leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen:",Swann's Way
7178,"the way towards Méséglise-la-Vineuse, which we called also 'Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,"way,' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M.",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's estate, and the 'Guermantes way.' Of Méséglise-la-Vineuse, to",Swann's Way
7178,"tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and",Swann's Way
7178,the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in,Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would",Swann's Way
7178,"'know at all,' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must",Swann's Way
7178,"have come over from Méséglise.' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well",Swann's Way
7178,"enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole",Swann's Way
7178,"of my boyhood, if Méséglise was to me something as inaccessible as the",Swann's Way
7178,"horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the",Swann's Way
7178,folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the,Swann's Way
7178,"country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than",Swann's Way
7178,"the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the 'Guermantes way,' a",Swann's Way
7178,sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator.,Swann's Way
7178,"And so to 'take the Guermantes way' in order to get to Méséglise, or",Swann's Way
7178,"vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to",Swann's Way
7178,turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always,Swann's Way
7178,to speak of the 'Méséglise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain,Swann's Way
7178,"that he knew anywhere, and of the 'Guermantes way' as typical of river",Swann's Way
7178,"scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as",Swann's Way
7178,"two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs",Swann's Way
7178,only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of,Swann's Way
7178,"them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special",Swann's Way
7178,"excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first",Swann's Way
7178,"stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the",Swann's Way
7178,"other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they",Swann's Way
7178,were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a,Swann's Way
7178,"river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen",Swann's Way
7178,"playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may",Swann's Way
7178,"happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between",Swann's Way
7178,"them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and",Swann's Way
7178,"inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was",Swann's Way
7178,"between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one",Swann's Way
7178,"of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which",Swann's Way
7178,"separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever",Swann's Way
7178,upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more,Swann's Way
7178,absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same,Swann's Way
7178,"day, or in the course of the same walk, but the 'Méséglise way' one time",Swann's Way
7178,"and the 'Guermantes way' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart",Swann's Way
7178,"and unaware of each other's existence, in the sealed vessels--between",Swann's Way
7178,which there could be no communication--of separate afternoons.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,When we had decided to go the 'Méséglise way' we would start (without,Swann's Way
7178,"undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was",Swann's Way
7178,"not very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were",Swann's Way
7178,"not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt's house,",Swann's Way
7178,which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by,Swann's Way
7178,"the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell",Swann's Way
7178,"Théodore, from Françoise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil",Swann's Way
7178,"or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the",Swann's Way
7178,white fence of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it we would be met on,Swann's Way
7178,"our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers.",Swann's Way
7178,Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised,Swann's Way
7178,inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple,Swann's Way
7178,"blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which",Swann's Way
7178,"they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little",Swann's Way
7178,"tiled house, called the Archers' Lodge, in which Swann's keeper lived,",Swann's Way
7178,overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of,Swann's Way
7178,spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these,Swann's Way
7178,"young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid",Swann's Way
7178,colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms,Swann's Way
7178,about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks,Swann's Way
7178,"that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without",Swann's Way
7178,"stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,"marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we",Swann's Way
7178,"would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then",Swann's Way
7178,"climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in",Swann's Way
7178,"the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far",Swann's Way
7178,from home.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One day my grandfather said to my 'father: ""Don't you remember Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims,Swann's Way
7178,and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in,Swann's Way
7178,"Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home;",Swann's Way
7178,"that will make it a little shorter.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some,Swann's Way
7178,"of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny",Swann's Way
7178,"balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only",Swann's Way
7178,"a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam,",Swann's Way
7178,"these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry",Swann's Way
7178,and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects,Swann's Way
7178,"the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had",Swann's Way
7178,"altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day",Swann's Way
7178,"of his wife's death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once",Swann's Way
7178,"again, the story of that walk.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare,Swann's Way
7178,of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away,Swann's Way
7178,"into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which",Swann's Way
7178,"stood close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is",Swann's Way
7178,the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in,Swann's Way
7178,"remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty,",Swann's Way
7178,and will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out',Swann's Way
7178,"scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human",Swann's Way
7178,"interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf",Swann's Way
7178,"them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and",Swann's Way
7178,"superimposing itself upon the work of man's hands. And so it was that,",Swann's Way
7178,"at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there",Swann's Way
7178,"might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below",Swann's Way
7178,"and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland",Swann's Way
7178,"which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the",Swann's Way
7178,"iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out",Swann's Way
7178,"over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered",Swann's Way
7178,"glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The absence of Mlle. Swann, which--since it preserved me from the",Swann's Way
7178,"terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being",Swann's Way
7178,identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had,Swann's Way
7178,Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals--made,Swann's Way
7178,"the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a",Swann's Way
7178,"matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property,",Swann's Way
7178,"in my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm,",Swann's Way
7178,and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to,Swann's Way
7178,make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction;,Swann's Way
7178,"I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a",Swann's Way
7178,"miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we",Swann's Way
7178,"should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make",Swann's Way
7178,"her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying",Swann's Way
7178,forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing,Swann's Way
7178,"in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather",Swann's Way
7178,"looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after",Swann's Way
7178,"all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not,",Swann's Way
7178,"really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the",Swann's Way
7178,"house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a",Swann's Way
7178,footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the,Swann's Way
7178,"tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately",Swann's Way
7178,"attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long,",Swann's Way
7178,"continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it",Swann's Way
7178,"received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of",Swann's Way
7178,"silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested",Swann's Way
7178,for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more,Swann's Way
7178,quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was,Swann's Way
7178,"naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and",Swann's Way
7178,"even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by",Swann's Way
7178,"the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt,",Swann's Way
7178,"of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight",Swann's Way
7178,"of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at",Swann's Way
7178,full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost,Swann's Way
7178,"vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and",Swann's Way
7178,"I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the",Swann's Way
7178,"terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my",Swann's Way
7178,duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting--when I was obliged,Swann's Way
7178,"to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were",Swann's Way
7178,"surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing",Swann's Way
7178,"up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I",Swann's Way
7178,found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom.,Swann's Way
7178,"The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer",Swann's Way
7178,visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their,Swann's Way
7178,"altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the",Swann's Way
7178,"ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent",Swann's Way
7178,"that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in",Swann's Way
7178,"its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of",Swann's Way
7178,"glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves'",Swann's Way
7178,"in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church,",Swann's Way
7178,framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery,Swann's Way
7178,"of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like",Swann's Way
7178,"strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with",Swann's Way
7178,"these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be",Swann's Way
7178,"climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the",Swann's Way
7178,"smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and",Swann's Way
7178,scattered by the first breath of wind.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in,",Swann's Way
7178,"to marshal before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose",Swann's Way
7178,"in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb",Swann's Way
7178,myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with,Swann's Way
7178,"the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as",Swann's Way
7178,certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation,Swann's Way
7178,"of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting",Swann's Way
7178,"me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play",Swann's Way
7178,over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their,Swann's Way
7178,secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return,Swann's Way
7178,"to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which,",Swann's Way
7178,"outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed",Swann's Way
7178,"and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen",Swann's Way
7178,"lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals",Swann's Way
7178,hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself;,Swann's Way
7178,"infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us",Swann's Way
7178,"that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse",Swann's Way
7178,"of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single",Swann's Way
7178,poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze,Swann's Way
7178,"its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it",Swann's Way
7178,"sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives, upon",Swann's Way
7178,"some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and",Swann's Way
7178,"made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of",Swann's Way
7178,"it, ""The Sea!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands",Swann's Way
7178,"before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will",Swann's Way
7178,"be better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at",Swann's Way
7178,"something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as",Swann's Way
7178,to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which,Swann's Way
7178,"they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing",Swann's Way
7178,"to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any",Swann's Way
7178,"other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring",Swann's Way
7178,me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite,Swann's Way
7178,"painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or,",Swann's Way
7178,"better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a",Swann's Way
7178,"picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch,",Swann's Way
7178,or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano,Swann's Way
7178,bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an,Swann's Way
7178,"orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge",Swann's Way
7178,"of Tansonville, said: ""You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink",Swann's Way
7178,"one; isn't it pretty?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and",Swann's Way
7178,"lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of",Swann's Way
7178,"those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion,",Swann's Way
7178,"because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular",Swann's Way
7178,"holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for",Swann's Way
7178,"such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially",Swann's Way
7178,"festal--but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to",Swann's Way
7178,"leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about",Swann's Way
7178,"the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,'",Swann's Way
7178,"and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, to the 'plain,' if one was to judge by the scale of prices",Swann's Way
7178,"at the 'stores' in the Square, or at Camus's, where the most expensive",Swann's Way
7178,biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a,Swann's Way
7178,"higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed",Swann's Way
7178,to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen,Swann's Way
7178,"precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some",Swann's Way
7178,"exquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival, which colours,",Swann's Way
7178,"inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those",Swann's Way
7178,"whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that",Swann's Way
7178,reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other,Swann's Way
7178,"tints, even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no",Swann's Way
7178,"gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the",Swann's Way
7178,"dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before",Swann's Way
7178,"the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no",Swann's Way
7178,"artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal",Swann's Way
7178,"intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself",Swann's Way
7178,who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from,Swann's Way
7178,"a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some",Swann's Way
7178,"procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too",Swann's Way
7178,"ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches,",Swann's Way
7178,"like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets",Swann's Way
7178,"of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on",Swann's Way
7178,"the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler",Swann's Way
7178,"in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of",Swann's Way
7178,"pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly",Swann's Way
7178,"than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the",Swann's Way
7178,"hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to",Swann's Way
7178,"blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place",Swann's Way
7178,"in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday",Swann's Way
7178,"attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying",Swann's Way
7178,"at home, equipped and ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed",Swann's Way
7178,"already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments,",Swann's Way
7178,"a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered",Swann's Way
7178,"with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open",Swann's Way
7178,"their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old",Swann's Way
7178,"Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted",Swann's Way
7178,"green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan",Swann's Way
7178,"of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable",Swann's Way
7178,"to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes",Swann's Way
7178,"possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish",Swann's Way

7178,"hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish",Swann's Way
7178,"freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know,",Swann's Way
7178,and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective,Swann's Way
7178,"elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough",Swann's Way
7178,"'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long",Swann's Way
7178,"time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her",Swann's Way
7178,"complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been",Swann's Way
7178,quite so black--which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting,Swann's Way
7178,"her--I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their",Swann's Way
7178,imagined blue.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger",Swann's Way
7178,"from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out,",Swann's Way
7178,"petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture,",Swann's Way
7178,"bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the",Swann's Way
7178,body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and,Swann's Way
7178,"father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by",Swann's Way
7178,"making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously",Swann's Way
7178,"appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to",Swann's Way
7178,"see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take",Swann's Way
7178,"stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she",Swann's Way
7178,"formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away",Swann's Way
7178,"with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to",Swann's Way
7178,spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of,Swann's Way
7178,"vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had",Swann's Way
7178,"overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space",Swann's Way
7178,"that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression,",Swann's Way
7178,"without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden",Swann's Way
7178,"smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I",Swann's Way
7178,"had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite",Swann's Way
7178,"disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an",Swann's Way
7178,"indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a",Swann's Way
7178,"person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which",Swann's Way
7178,"I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate",Swann's Way
7178,insult.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?"" called out in a piercing",Swann's Way
7178,"tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen",Swann's Way
7178,"'ducks,' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed",Swann's Way
7178,"to be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded,",Swann's Way
7178,"and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in",Swann's Way
7178,"my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a",Swann's Way
7178,"talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom",Swann's Way
7178,"its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a",Swann's Way
7178,"moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came",Swann's Way
7178,"to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and",Swann's Way
7178,cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating,Swann's Way
7178,"and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which",Swann's Way
7178,"it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the",Swann's Way
7178,life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that,Swann's Way
7178,lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the,Swann's Way
7178,"arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder,",Swann's Way
7178,the quintessence of their familiarity--so exquisitely painful to,Swann's Way
7178,"myself--with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into",Swann's Way
7178,which I should never penetrate.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: ""Poor",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so",Swann's Way
7178,that she can be left alone with her Charlus--for that was Charlus: I,Swann's Way
7178,"recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up",Swann's Way
7178,"in all that!"") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting",Swann's Way
7178,"her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not",Swann's Way
7178,"being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat,",Swann's Way
7178,"revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon",Swann's Way
7178,that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated,Swann's Way
7178,"heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down",Swann's Way
7178,to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the,Swann's Way
7178,"inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep",Swann's Way
7178,some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have,Swann's Way
7178,liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and,Swann's Way
7178,"shout, ""I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!""",Swann's Way
7178,"However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards,",Swann's Way
7178,as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible,Swann's Way
7178,to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was,Swann's Way
7178,"impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish",Swann's Way
7178,"hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in",Swann's Way
7178,"her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and",Swann's Way
7178,"inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a",Swann's Way
7178,"cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through",Swann's Way
7178,"which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to",Swann's Way
7178,"conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had",Swann's Way
7178,"any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably",Swann's Way
7178,"fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even",Swann's Way
7178,"the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in",Swann's Way
7178,Paris.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Léonie,"" said my grandfather on our return, ""I wish we had had you with",Swann's Way
7178,us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had,Swann's Way
7178,the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used,Swann's Way
7178,"to like so much."" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk,",Swann's Way
7178,"either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope",Swann's Way
7178,that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of,Swann's Way
7178,"doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and,",Swann's Way
7178,"moreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to",Swann's Way
7178,"receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the",Swann's Way
7178,"world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for",Swann's Way
7178,her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would,Swann's Way
7178,"ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment",Swann's Way
7178,"and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time,",Swann's Way
7178,"so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, ""Yes, some day when the",Swann's Way
7178,"weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.""",Swann's Way
7178,And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see,Swann's Way
7178,Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all,Swann's Way
7178,"that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more",Swann's Way
7178,than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more,Swann's Way
7178,"energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had",Swann's Way
7178,"reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on",Swann's Way
7178,returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her--and in her a,Swann's Way
7178,little earlier only than it must come to all of us--was the great and,Swann's Way
7178,"general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the",Swann's Way
7178,"chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been",Swann's Way
7178,unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with,Swann's Way
7178,"the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest",Swann's Way
7178,"ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make the",Swann's Way
7178,"necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease",Swann's Way
7178,"to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this",Swann's Way
7178,world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not,Swann's Way
7178,"see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but",Swann's Way
7178,this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more,Swann's Way
7178,"readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made",Swann's Way
7178,"it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by",Swann's Way
7178,the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to,Swann's Way
7178,"measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to",Swann's Way
7178,"her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the",Swann's Way
7178,"blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all",Swann's Way
7178,hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was,Swann's Way
7178,"not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to",Swann's Way
7178,"Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and",Swann's Way
7178,"grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods.",Swann's Way
7178,"The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann--when I",Swann's Way
7178,talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them,Swann's Way
7178,"utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a",Swann's Way
7178,"discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in",Swann's Way
7178,"which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too",Swann's Way
7178,remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father,Swann's Way
7178,"(by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business",Swann's Way
7178,"had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink",Swann's Way
7178,hawthorn which my aunt Léonie wished to visit was on common ground) to,Swann's Way
7178,"correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his",Swann's Way
7178,"own accord: ""No, no, the business belonged to _Swann's_ father, that",Swann's Way
7178,"hedge is part of _Swann's_ park."" And then I would be obliged to pause",Swann's Way
7178,"for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it",Swann's Way
7178,"was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard",Swann's Way
7178,"it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because",Swann's Way
7178,it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had,Swann's Way
7178,secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was,Swann's Way
7178,"ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it",Swann's Way
7178,that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity,Swann's Way
7178,"of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by,Swann's Way
7178,"a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had",Swann's Way
7178,"stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it",Swann's Way
7178,was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could,Swann's Way
7178,"not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves",Swann's Way
7178,"sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they",Swann's Way
7178,"condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as",Swann's Way
7178,wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their,Swann's Way
7178,hearts.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather,Swann's Way
7178,earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my,Swann's Way
7178,"hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat",Swann's Way
7178,"carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket;",Swann's Way
7178,"a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me",Swann's Way
7178,"standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville,",Swann's Way
7178,"bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches",Swann's Way
7178,"to my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight",Swann's Way
7178,of all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious,Swann's Way
7178,"hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all",Swann's Way
7178,my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I,Swann's Way
7178,"had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at",Swann's Way
7178,"all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of",Swann's Way
7178,"my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her.",Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, my poor little hawthorns,"" I was assuring them through my sobs, ""it",Swann's Way
7178,"is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you.",Swann's Way
7178,"You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you."" And,",Swann's Way
7178,"drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy",Swann's Way
7178,"the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring",Swann's Way
7178,"days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make",Swann's Way
7178,excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our,Swann's Way
7178,"Méséglise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible",Swann's Way
7178,"streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I",Swann's Way
7178,"really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again",Swann's Way
7178,"through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always",Swann's Way
7178,"had the wind for companion when one went the 'Méséglise way,' on",Swann's Way
7178,"that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any",Swann's Way
7178,disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often,Swann's Way
7178,"to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many",Swann's Way
7178,"miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening",Swann's Way
7178,"obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge",Swann's Way
7178,"from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant",Swann's Way
7178,"fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally",Swann's Way
7178,"settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my",Swann's Way
7178,"feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us",Swann's Way
7178,"together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed",Swann's Way
7178,"by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was",Swann's Way
7178,"whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would",Swann's Way
7178,catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu,Swann's Way
7178,"(_Campus Pagani_, according to the Curé). On my right I could see",Swann's Way
7178,"across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-André-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated,",Swann's Way
7178,"honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the",Swann's Way
7178,"apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging",Swann's Way
7178,"in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going",Swann's Way
7178,the 'Méséglise way' that I first noticed the circular shadow which,Swann's Way
7178,"apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable",Swann's Way
7178,threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards,Swann's Way
7178,"from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through",Swann's Way

7178,Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little,Swann's Way
7178,"cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have",Swann's Way
7178,"to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary",Swann's Way
7178,"clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the",Swann's Way
7178,"background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to",Swann's Way
7178,"find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of",Swann's Way
7178,"art were very different--at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had",Swann's Way
7178,attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies--from those in,Swann's Way
7178,"which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have",Swann's Way
7178,"recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine,",Swann's Way
7178,"some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the",Swann's Way
7178,"sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and",Swann's Way
7178,"as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it",Swann's Way
7178,enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. They held that one,Swann's Way
7178,"ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate",Swann's Way
7178,"good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would",Swann's Way
7178,continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt,Swann's Way
7178,they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded,Swann's Way
7178,"vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their",Swann's Way

7178,"edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that",Swann's Way
7178,M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her,Swann's Way
7178,dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never,Swann's Way
7178,"saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than",Swann's Way
7178,"herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end",Swann's Way
7178,"installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said:",Swann's Way
7178,"""That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone",Swann's Way
7178,"is talking about, and to let his daughter--a man who is horrified if you",Swann's Way
7178,use a word in the wrong sense--bring a woman like that to live under his,Swann's Way
7178,"roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold,",Swann's Way
7178,and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had,Swann's Way
7178,only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching,Swann's Way
7178,"his daughter."" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed",Swann's Way
7178,it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their,Swann's Way
7178,normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in,Swann's Way
7178,"physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly",Swann's Way
7178,"decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them",Swann's Way
7178,"of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine",Swann's Way
7178,"resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud",Swann's Way

7178,"his daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave,",Swann's Way
7178,could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a,Swann's Way
7178,"broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to",Swann's Way
7178,"the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed,",Swann's Way
7178,"what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid",Swann's Way
7178,"his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of",Swann's Way
7178,"circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which",Swann's Way
7178,"he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first",Swann's Way
7178,recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his,Swann's Way
7178,"presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the",Swann's Way
7178,"unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand",Swann's Way
7178,reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must,Swann's Way
7178,have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have,Swann's Way
7178,to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed,Swann's Way
7178,to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there,Swann's Way
7178,needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a,Swann's Way
7178,"vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by",Swann's Way
7178,"no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might",Swann's Way
7178,blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil,Swann's Way
7178,may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his,Swann's Way
7178,adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to,Swann's Way
7178,the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that,Swann's Way
7178,"engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they",Swann's Way
7178,can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without,Swann's Way
7178,"weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one",Swann's Way
7178,"after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not",Swann's Way
7178,make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of,Swann's Way
7178,its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself,Swann's Way
7178,"from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he",Swann's Way
7178,attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied,Swann's Way
7178,"in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give",Swann's Way
7178,"judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely",Swann's Way
7178,the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his,Swann's Way
7178,"daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the",Swann's Way
7178,"very 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late",Swann's Way
7178,"been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked",Swann's Way
7178,above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they,Swann's Way
7178,"might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of",Swann's Way
7178,"rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any",Swann's Way
7178,human misfortune.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so",Swann's Way
7178,suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who,",Swann's Way
7178,"amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's",Swann's Way
7178,"shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the",Swann's Way
7178,outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of,Swann's Way
7178,the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him,Swann's Way
7178,"upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil,",Swann's Way
7178,"with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and",Swann's Way
7178,"invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day,",Swann's Way
7178,"to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier,",Swann's Way
7178,"would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much",Swann's Way
7178,gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion,Swann's Way
7178,of accepting. Swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to,Swann's Way
7178,"be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he",Swann's Way
7178,"felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the",Swann's Way
7178,wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What a charming man!"" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the",Swann's Way
7178,same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the,Swann's Way
7178,middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a,Swann's Way

7178,"a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most",Swann's Way
7178,"sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the",Swann's Way
7178,opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer,Swann's Way
7178,"there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann's marriage,",Swann's Way
7178,invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they,Swann's Way
7178,"invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good",Swann's Way
7178,fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way,Swann's Way
7178,infringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly,",Swann's Way
7178,"after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning",Swann's Way
7178,"for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself,",Swann's Way
7178,"one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined",Swann's Way
7178,that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil,Swann's Way
7178,should appear with his daughter at Tansonville.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Since the 'Méséglise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to,Swann's Way
7178,"take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for",Swann's Way
7178,"days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of Méséglise",Swann's Way
7178,"shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the",Swann's Way
7178,"fringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for",Swann's Way
7178,shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its",Swann's Way
7178,"roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness,",Swann's Way
7178,"though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape",Swann's Way
7178,"in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village",Swann's Way
7178,of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its,Swann's Way
7178,"gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from",Swann's Way
7178,"its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while",Swann's Way
7178,beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of,Swann's Way
7178,"blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still",Swann's Way
7178,find decorating the walls of old houses.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due",Swann's Way
7178,warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung,Swann's Way
7178,"out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a",Swann's Way
7178,"body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching",Swann's Way
7178,"order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in",Swann's Way
7178,"their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw",Swann's Way
7178,"after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly",Swann's Way
7178,darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the,Swann's Way
7178,"trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last",Swann's Way
7178,"drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we",Swann's Way
7178,"would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now,",Swann's Way
7178,"among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a",Swann's Way
7178,"stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and",Swann's Way
7178,hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump,Swann's Way
7178,upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony",Swann's Way
7178,"saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs. How",Swann's Way
7178,"typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings",Swann's Way
7178,"of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals",Swann's Way
7178,were carved as they might have been in the mind of Françoise. The,Swann's Way
7178,"sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil,",Swann's Way
7178,precisely as Françoise in her kitchen would break into speech about,Swann's Way
7178,"Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to",Swann's Way
7178,"depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered",Swann's Way
7178,less 'righteous.' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval,Swann's Way
7178,artist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in,Swann's Way
7178,"the nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history,",Swann's Way
7178,"ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were",Swann's Way
7178,"derived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct,",Swann's Way
7178,"unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray",Swann's Way
7178,"person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic",Swann's Way
7178,"sculptures of Saint-André-des-Champs was young Théodore, the assistant",Swann's Way
7178,"in Camus's shop. And, indeed, Françoise herself was well aware that she",Swann's Way
7178,"had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill",Swann's Way
7178,"for Françoise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry",Swann's Way
7178,"her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs",Swann's Way
7178,"and, perhaps, 'make an impression' on my aunt, she would send out for",Swann's Way
7178,"Théodore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town",Swann's Way
7178,"as a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served",Swann's Way
7178,"to decorate the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, and particularly in the",Swann's Way
7178,"feelings of respect due, in Françoise eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and,",Swann's Way
7178,"above all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down",Swann's Way
7178,"to raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of préraphaélite",Swann's Way
7178,"simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who",Swann's Way
7178,"throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter,",Swann's Way
7178,"were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower",Swann's Way
7178,"again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of",Swann's Way
7178,"Théodore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but",Swann's Way
7178,"detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her",Swann's Way
7178,"pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her",Swann's Way
7178,"feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full",Swann's Way
7178,"cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like",Swann's Way
7178,"a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and",Swann's Way
7178,"stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous",Swann's Way
7178,"expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which",Swann's Way
7178,imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to,Swann's Way
7178,"find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from",Swann's Way
7178,"the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose",Swann's Way
7178,presence there--as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up,Swann's Way
7178,"beside leaves carved in stone--seemed intended by fate to allow us, by",Swann's Way
7178,"confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate",Swann's Way
7178,"of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a",Swann's Way
7178,"promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had",Swann's Way
7178,"never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for",Swann's Way
7178,"us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by",Swann's Way
7178,"all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down",Swann's Way
7178,"obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already",Swann's Way
7178,"received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the",Swann's Way
7178,"light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the",Swann's Way
7178,rays of a monstrance upon an altar.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go",Swann's Way
7178,"home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in",Swann's Way
7178,"a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere,",Swann's Way
7178,"resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower",Swann's Way
7178,slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone,Swann's Way
7178,out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at,Swann's Way
7178,"anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm?",Swann's Way
7178,"In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial",Swann's Way
7178,"ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very",Swann's Way
7178,"different thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter,",Swann's Way
7178,"its very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the",Swann's Way

7178,"flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of",Swann's Way
7178,"the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white.",Swann's Way
7178,"Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner",Swann's Way
7178,"with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees,",Swann's Way
7178,but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the,Swann's Way
7178,"greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves",Swann's Way
7178,"had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the",Swann's Way
7178,"rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather's continuing; it might",Swann's Way
7178,"rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville,",Swann's Way
7178,"there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little",Swann's Way
7178,heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the,Swann's Way
7178,"poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation",Swann's Way
7178,"before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end",Swann's Way
7178,"of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of",Swann's Way
7178,"a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit",Swann's Way
7178,"of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards",Swann's Way
7178,"Méséglise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray",Swann's Way
7178,to settle the division of my aunt Léonie's estate; for she had died at,Swann's Way
7178,"last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the",Swann's Way
7178,fact of her demise--those who had insisted that her mode of life was,Swann's Way
7178,"enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had",Swann's Way
7178,"always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary,",Swann's Way
7178,"but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would",Swann's Way
7178,"be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it;",Swann's Way
7178,"causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that",Swann's Way
7178,one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my,Swann's Way
7178,"aunt's last illness Françoise never went out of her room for an instant,",Swann's Way
7178,"never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my",Swann's Way
7178,"aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave.",Swann's Way
7178,"Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Françoise",Swann's Way
7178,"had lived of my aunt's harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had",Swann's Way
7178,"developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which",Swann's Way
7178,"was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it",Swann's Way
7178,"had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been",Swann's Way
7178,"so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take",Swann's Way
7178,"advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no",Swann's Way
7178,more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The,Swann's Way
7178,"time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays",Swann's Way
7178,"at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Françoise eyes, with my",Swann's Way
7178,aunt.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with",Swann's Way
7178,"the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with",Swann's Way
7178,"solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it",Swann's Way
7178,"happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them,",Swann's Way
7178,"along the 'Méséglise way,' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which",Swann's Way
7178,"protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw",Swann's Way
7178,over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan,Swann's Way
7178,"scandalised Françoise, whom it was impossible to convince that the",Swann's Way
7178,colour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning,Swann's Way
7178,"for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's",Swann's Way
7178,"death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the",Swann's Way
7178,"neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone",Swann's Way
7178,"when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I",Swann's Way
7178,am sure that in a book--and to that extent my feelings were closely akin,Swann's Way
7178,"to those of Françoise--such a conception of mourning, in the manner",Swann's Way
7178,"of the _Chanson de Roland_ and of the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs,",Swann's Way
7178,would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Françoise herself,Swann's Way
7178,"approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry,",Swann's Way
7178,and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I,Swann's Way
7178,regretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of,Swann's Way
7178,"her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that",Swann's Way
7178,she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her,Swann's Way
7178,"death would not have caused me a moment's sorrow; statements which, in a",Swann's Way
7178,"book, would have struck me as merely fatuous.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And if Françoise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused",Swann's Way
7178,"reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to",Swann's Way
7178,"plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: ""I don't know how to",Swann's Way
7178,"_espress_ myself""--I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal",Swann's Way
7178,"common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: ""All the same",Swann's Way

7178,contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used",Swann's Way

7178,"reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid",Swann's Way
7178,"across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of",Swann's Way
7178,"enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was",Swann's Way
7178,"now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in",Swann's Way
7178,"every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees",Swann's Way
7178,"of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its",Swann's Way
7178,"back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must",Swann's Way
7178,"hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than",Swann's Way

7178,emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us,Swann's Way
7178,of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in,Swann's Way
7178,an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted.,Swann's Way
7178,"When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the 'Méséglise way,' all",Swann's Way

7178,"the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same",Swann's Way
7178,"autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded",Swann's Way
7178,"Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by",Swann's Way
7178,this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of,Swann's Way
7178,"expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a",Swann's Way
7178,"brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached",Swann's Way
7178,"a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil's gardener kept",Swann's Way
7178,"his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean",Swann's Way
7178,"by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall",Swann's Way
7178,"of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken",Swann's Way
7178,perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass,Swann's Way
7178,"that grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which",Swann's Way
7178,"things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent,",Swann's Way
7178,with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The,Swann's Way
7178,"tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again",Swann's Way
7178,"in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never",Swann's Way
7178,"observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the",Swann's Way
7178,"wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my",Swann's Way
7178,"enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: ""Damn, damn, damn, damn!""",Swann's Way
7178,But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content,Swann's Way
7178,"myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more",Swann's Way
7178,clearly into the sources of my enjoyment.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And it was at that moment, too--thanks to a peasant who went past,",Swann's Way
7178,"apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly",Swann's Way
7178,"received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality",Swann's Way
7178,"to my ""Fine day, what! good to be out walking!""--that I learned",Swann's Way
7178,that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men,Swann's Way
7178,"simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that,",Swann's Way
7178,"whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the",Swann's Way
7178,friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment,Swann's Way
7178,"have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and",Swann's Way
7178,wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been,Swann's Way
7178,"thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and",Swann's Way
7178,"proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using",Swann's Way
7178,the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already,Swann's Way
7178,"forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself",Swann's Way
7178,upon them with a kiss.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be,Swann's Way
7178,"added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to",Swann's Way
7178,which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire,Swann's Way
7178,to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my,Swann's Way
7178,"arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately",Swann's Way
7178,"to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was,Swann's Way
7178,given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything,Swann's Way
7178,"that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled",Swann's Way
7178,"roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into",Swann's Way
7178,"which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the",Swann's Way
7178,"steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made",Swann's Way
7178,them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that,Swann's Way
7178,"had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly",Swann's Way
7178,"towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and",Swann's Way
7178,propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added,Swann's Way
7178,"for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their",Swann's Way
7178,"turn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much",Swann's Way
7178,restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers,Swann's Way
7178,"also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of",Swann's Way
7178,"Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her",Swann's Way
7178,"kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing",Swann's Way
7178,"strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding",Swann's Way
7178,"through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any",Swann's Way
7178,"bounds. Moreover--just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature,",Swann's Way
7178,"the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas",Swann's Way
7178,"of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the",Swann's Way
7178,"originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may",Swann's Way
7178,happen to be--the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be,Swann's Way
7178,"not any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and",Swann's Way
7178,natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not,Swann's Way
7178,"myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious,",Swann's Way
7178,"more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear",Swann's Way
7178,to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made,Swann's Way
7178,no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from Méséglise or,Swann's Way
7178,"Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for",Swann's Way
7178,Balbec and Méséglise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to,Swann's Way
7178,"give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in",Swann's Way
7178,"it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I",Swann's Way
7178,chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from,Swann's Way
7178,Méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which,Swann's Way
7178,"I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found",Swann's Way
7178,"among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was",Swann's Way
7178,about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my,Swann's Way
7178,imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of,Swann's Way
7178,Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods,Swann's Way
7178,"and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty.",Swann's Way
7178,That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their,Swann's Way
7178,"leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the",Swann's Way
7178,"rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely",Swann's Way
7178,than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had,Swann's Way
7178,sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that,Swann's Way
7178,the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were,Swann's Way
7178,"themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could",Swann's Way
7178,"never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long",Swann's Way
7178,"remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact",Swann's Way
7178,of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has,Swann's Way
7178,"tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one",Swann's Way
7178,regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that,Swann's Way
7178,"is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and",Swann's Way
7178,"formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one",Swann's Way
7178,"seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in",Swann's Way
7178,"anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself,",Swann's Way
7178,"but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and",Swann's Way
7178,"concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it",Swann's Way
7178,"makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender",Swann's Way
7178,"glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more",Swann's Way
7178,"than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of",Swann's Way
7178,"heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves,",Swann's Way
7178,"which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon",Swann's Way
7178,us.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville,",Swann's Way
7178,"that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village,",Swann's Way
7178,appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my,Swann's Way
7178,"earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from",Swann's Way
7178,"the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window,",Swann's Way
7178,"while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for",Swann's Way
7178,"unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of",Swann's Way
7178,"self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of",Swann's Way
7178,"my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to",Swann's Way
7178,"my death, even--until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among",Swann's Way
7178,"the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window,",Swann's Way
7178,tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I,Swann's Way
7178,"compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with",Swann's Way
7178,an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I,Swann's Way
7178,might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs: never did,Swann's Way
7178,"I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with",Swann's Way
7178,"my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix",Swann's Way
7178,"my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from",Swann's Way
7178,behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny,Swann's Way
7178,left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope,Swann's Way
7178,"now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it",Swann's Way
7178,"the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale",Swann's Way
7178,"and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with",Swann's Way
7178,"sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from",Swann's Way
7178,among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they,Swann's Way
7178,"had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama,",Swann's Way
7178,"when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having",Swann's Way
7178,"held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to",Swann's Way
7178,"retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance",Swann's Way
7178,of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had,Swann's Way
7178,"appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have",Swann's Way
7178,"regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came",Swann's Way
7178,"to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others,",Swann's Way
7178,or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more,Swann's Way
7178,"now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my",Swann's Way
7178,"temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and",Swann's Way
7178,"significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional",Swann's Way
7178,"framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway",Swann's Way
7178,"carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at,Swann's Way
7178,"Montjouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was",Swann's Way
7178,"without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that",Swann's Way
7178,"cruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due",Swann's Way
7178,"course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was",Swann's Way
7178,to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot,Swann's Way
7178,"weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day,",Swann's Way
7178,had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having,Swann's Way
7178,"gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the",Swann's Way
7178,"reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade",Swann's Way
7178,and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up,Swann's Way
7178,"behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before,",Swann's Way
7178,one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark,Swann's Way
7178,"when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mlle. Vinteuil",Swann's Way
7178,"(or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her",Swann's Way
7178,"often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas",Swann's Way
7178,"she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in,",Swann's Way
7178,"standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room",Swann's Way
7178,"in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made",Swann's Way
7178,into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the,Swann's Way
7178,lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being,Swann's Way
7178,"able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound",Swann's Way
7178,"among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I",Swann's Way
7178,had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had",Swann's Way
7178,"not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that",Swann's Way
7178,"virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence--namely,",Swann's Way
7178,modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My,Swann's Way
7178,"mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete",Swann's Way
7178,"absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his",Swann's Way
7178,"daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she",Swann's Way
7178,could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old,Swann's Way
7178,man's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely,Swann's Way
7178,abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later,Swann's Way
7178,"work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a",Swann's Way
7178,"retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value",Swann's Way
7178,"in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such",Swann's Way
7178,great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he,Swann's Way
7178,"sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even",Swann's Way
7178,"written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were",Swann's Way
7178,"scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain",Swann's Way
7178,"unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more",Swann's Way
7178,"cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when",Swann's Way
7178,she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come,Swann's Way
7178,"upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and",Swann's Way
7178,"shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness,",Swann's Way
7178,"which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having",Swann's Way
7178,"virtually killed her father. ""Poor M. Vinteuil,"" my mother would say,",Swann's Way
7178,"""he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting",Swann's Way
7178,"his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only",Swann's Way
7178,"come to him from her.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece,",Swann's Way
7178,"stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch,",Swann's Way
7178,"just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside,",Swann's Way
7178,then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little,Swann's Way
7178,"table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil",Swann's Way
7178,had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked,Swann's Way
7178,to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil,Swann's Way
7178,"greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and",Swann's Way
7178,"drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no",Swann's Way
7178,sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps,Swann's Way
7178,"suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which",Swann's Way
7178,might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would,Swann's Way
7178,"prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair;",Swann's Way
7178,she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright;,Swann's Way
7178,"stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep,",Swann's Way
7178,"and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude",Swann's Way
7178,and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could,Swann's Way
7178,"recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt",Swann's Way
7178,scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently,Swann's Way
7178,"she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to",Swann's Way
7178,close the shutters and not succeeding.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Leave them open,"" said her friend. ""I am hot.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But it's too dreadful! People will see us,"" Mlle. Vinteuil answered.",Swann's Way
7178,"And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had",Swann's Way
7178,uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other,Swann's Way
7178,"words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from",Swann's Way
7178,"prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although",Swann's Way
7178,"I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression",Swann's Way
7178,must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so,Swann's Way
7178,"delightful, when she hastily went on: ""When I say 'see us' I mean, of",Swann's Way
7178,"course, see us reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial",Swann's Way
7178,"little thing you do some one may be overlooking you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her",Swann's Way
7178,"control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had",Swann's Way
7178,"felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And",Swann's Way
7178,"perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden",Swann's Way
7178,"would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but",Swann's Way
7178,"triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at",Swann's Way
7178,"this time of night in this densely populated district!"" said her friend,",Swann's Way
7178,"with bitter irony. ""And what if they are?"" she went on, feeling bound",Swann's Way
7178,to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which,Swann's Way
7178,"she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand",Swann's Way
7178,"which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. ""And what if",Swann's Way
7178,"they are? All the better that they should see us.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive,Swann's Way
7178,"and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow,",Swann's Way
7178,"spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her",Swann's Way
7178,eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the,Swann's Way
7178,limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to,Swann's Way
7178,"a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the",Swann's Way
7178,"words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with",Swann's Way
7178,sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed,Swann's Way
7178,"herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained",Swann's Way
7178,timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while,Swann's Way
7178,"she kept on interrupting herself with: ""You're sure you aren't cold? You",Swann's Way
7178,aren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself?...,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,"" she",Swann's Way
7178,"concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on",Swann's Way
7178,"some earlier occasion, by her friend.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the,Swann's Way
7178,sting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and,Swann's Way
7178,"ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room,",Swann's Way
7178,"scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like",Swann's Way
7178,"wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle.",Swann's Way
7178,"Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from",Swann's Way
7178,me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back,Swann's Way
7178,turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had,Swann's Way
7178,been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see,Swann's Way
7178,"it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she",Swann's Way
7178,"herself had just noticed it for the first time: ""Oh! there's my father's",Swann's Way
7178,picture looking at us; I can't think who can have put it there; I'm sure,Swann's Way
7178,"I've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in,Swann's Way
7178,"apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of",Swann's Way
7178,"course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to",Swann's Way
7178,"daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently",Swann's Way
7178,"a liturgical response: ""Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any",Swann's Way
7178,"longer. D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out",Swann's Way
7178,"of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old",Swann's Way
7178,"monkey?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, ""Oh, please!""--a gentle reproach",Swann's Way
7178,"which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it",Swann's Way
7178,was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this,Swann's Way
7178,"fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself,",Swann's Way
7178,"by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such",Swann's Way
7178,"moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all",Swann's Way
7178,"appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which",Swann's Way
7178,"her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been,",Swann's Way
7178,"too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these",Swann's Way
7178,"blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her",Swann's Way
7178,frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form,Swann's Way
7178,of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to,Swann's Way
7178,adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with,Swann's Way
7178,affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards,Swann's Way
7178,the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held,Swann's Way
7178,out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done,Swann's Way
7178,"to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between",Swann's Way
7178,"them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M.",Swann's Way
7178,"Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred",Swann's Way
7178,rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl's head in her hands and,Swann's Way
7178,placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection,Swann's Way
7178,"she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what",Swann's Way
7178,distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?"" she said,",Swann's Way
7178,taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something,Swann's Way
7178,that I could not distinguish.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh! You would never dare.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Not dare to spit on it? On that?"" shouted the friend with deliberate",Swann's Way
7178,brutality.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,",Swann's Way
7178,"preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew",Swann's Way
7178,"the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil,",Swann's Way
7178,"in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on",Swann's Way
7178,"account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be,Swann's Way
7178,"present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have",Swann's Way
7178,"continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he",Swann's Way
7178,"might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true",Swann's Way
7178,that in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so,Swann's Way
7178,strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it,Swann's Way
7178,exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a,Swann's Way
7178,"'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under",Swann's Way
7178,"the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a",Swann's Way
7178,girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has,Swann's Way
7178,lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in,Swann's Way
7178,"real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic'",Swann's Way
7178,"instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being",Swann's Way
7178,"in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the",Swann's Way
7178,same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and,Swann's Way
7178,"defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them",Swann's Way
7178,"deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking",Swann's Way
7178,in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less,Swann's Way
7178,"evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have",Swann's Way
7178,"admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in",Swann's Way
7178,"Mlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element",Swann's Way
7178,"was probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil,",Swann's Way
7178,"which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil",Swann's Way
7178,"would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her,",Swann's Way
7178,and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for,Swann's Way
7178,"virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never",Swann's Way
7178,"have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious",Swann's Way
7178,delight in their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are,Swann's Way
7178,"creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even",Swann's Way
7178,"sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved",Swann's Way
7178,for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it,Swann's Way
7178,"they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of",Swann's Way
7178,"wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain",Swann's Way
7178,the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own,Swann's Way
7178,gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And,Swann's Way
7178,I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I,Swann's Way
7178,realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when,Swann's Way
7178,"she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at",Swann's Way
7178,"once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of",Swann's Way
7178,"the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she",Swann's Way
7178,"really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures,",Swann's Way
7178,but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any,Swann's Way
7178,"direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his",Swann's Way
7178,"mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to",Swann's Way
7178,"be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations",Swann's Way
7178,which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a,Swann's Way
7178,"phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it",Swann's Way
7178,as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and,Swann's Way
7178,courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil,Swann's Way
7178,"that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it",Swann's Way
7178,"was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she",Swann's Way
7178,"indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as,",Swann's Way
7178,"ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to",Swann's Way
7178,"see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil.",Swann's Way
7178,Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether,Swann's Way
7178,"bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous",Swann's Way
7178,"utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses",Swann's Way
7178,"on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin",Swann's Way
7178,in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have,Swann's Way
7178,been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness,Swann's Way
7178,"and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was",Swann's Way
7178,able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed,Swann's Way
7178,"amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a",Swann's Way
7178,girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy,Swann's Way
7178,towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of,Swann's Way
7178,"wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was",Swann's Way
7178,"so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself,",Swann's Way
7178,"as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings",Swann's Way
7178,"which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one",Swann's Way
7178,"true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"If the 'Méséglise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when",Swann's Way
7178,"we took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must",Swann's Way
7178,"make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a",Swann's Way
7178,"spell of fine days, when Françoise, in desperation that not a drop was",Swann's Way
7178,"falling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there",Swann's Way
7178,"only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure",Swann's Way
7178,"surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: ""You would say they were nothing",Swann's Way
7178,more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their,Swann's Way
7178,"snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor",Swann's Way
7178,"labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come,",Swann's Way
7178,"rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling",Swann's Way
7178,"than if it was on the sea!""--when my father's appeals to the gardener",Swann's Way
7178,"had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession,",Swann's Way
7178,"then some one would say, at dinner: ""To-morrow, if the weather holds,",Swann's Way
7178,"we might go the Guermantes way."" And off we would set, immediately after",Swann's Way
7178,"luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots",Swann's Way
7178,"over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street",Swann's Way
7178,"as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its",Swann's Way
7178,"personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search",Swann's Way
7178,"in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises",Swann's Way
7178,"upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects,",Swann's Way
7178,"pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath",Swann's Way
7178,"a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a",Swann's Way
7178,"Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably",Swann's Way
7178,was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice,Swann's Way
7178,"standing, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And",Swann's Way
7178,for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance,Swann's Way
7178,than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it,Swann's Way
7178,"has preserved--perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon",Swann's Way
7178,to follow the rest into oblivion--of what Combray looked like in my,Swann's Way
7178,"childhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray",Swann's Way
7178,"that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as",Swann's Way
7178,"moving--if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works,",Swann's Way
7178,reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me--as,Swann's Way
7178,"those old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile",Swann's Way
7178,"Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist,",Swann's Way
7178,the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"We would pass, in the Rue de l'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the",Swann's Way
7178,"Oiseau Flesché, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would",Swann's Way
7178,"rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes,",Swann's Way
7178,"and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some",Swann's Way
7178,"litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would",Swann's Way
7178,"come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the",Swann's Way
7178,steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down,Swann's Way
7178,"and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for",Swann's Way
7178,"it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you",Swann's Way
7178,"would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that",Swann's Way
7178,"it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do,",Swann's Way
7178,"had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops",Swann's Way
7178,"which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed,",Swann's Way
7178,"at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us,",Swann's Way
7178,"almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten",Swann's Way
7178,"minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux.",Swann's Way
7178,"And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the",Swann's Way
7178,"sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the",Swann's Way
7178,"disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous",Swann's Way
7178,preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they,Swann's Way
7178,have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river,Swann's Way
7178,"flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its",Swann's Way
7178,"only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few",Swann's Way
7178,"primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue",Swann's Way
7178,"flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of",Swann's Way
7178,"perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which,",Swann's Way
7178,"at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a",Swann's Way
7178,"hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken",Swann's Way
7178,"root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the",Swann's Way
7178,blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform,Swann's Way
7178,"or chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was",Swann's Way
7178,"never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to",Swann's Way
7178,raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the,Swann's Way
7178,"point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be",Swann's Way
7178,"quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which",Swann's Way
7178,"ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The",Swann's Way
7178,"ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad",Swann's Way
7178,meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station.,Swann's Way
7178,"Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of",Swann's Way
7178,"the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages,",Swann's Way
7178,had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence,Swann's Way
7178,against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville.,Swann's Way
7178,"Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad",Swann's Way
7178,"surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in",Swann's Way
7178,"their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out",Swann's Way
7178,"over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt,",Swann's Way
7178,"fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked;",Swann's Way
7178,"but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and",Swann's Way
7178,"commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there",Swann's Way
7178,"in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past",Swann's Way
7178,"that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by",Swann's Way
7178,"the water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong",Swann's Way
7178,"food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the",Swann's Way
7178,"little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different,",Swann's Way
7178,"seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible",Swann's Way
7178,features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups.,Swann's Way
7178,For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had,Swann's Way
7178,"chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in",Swann's Way
7178,"whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added",Swann's Way
7178,"lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate",Swann's Way
7178,"the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would",Swann's Way
7178,"let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until",Swann's Way
7178,it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of,Swann's Way
7178,"absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest",Swann's Way
7178,"childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards",Swann's Way
7178,"them, before even I could pronounce their charming name--a name fit for",Swann's Way
7178,"the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far",Swann's Way
7178,"distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village,",Swann's Way
7178,"well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine",Swann's Way
7178,"and the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the",Swann's Way
7178,"railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old",Swann's Way
7178,"paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the",Swann's Way
7178,golden East.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used,Swann's Way
7178,"to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the",Swann's Way
7178,"current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at",Swann's Way
7178,once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water,Swann's Way
7178,"and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid,",Swann's Way
7178,"flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more",Swann's Way
7178,"provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight",Swann's Way
7178,"between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided",Swann's Way
7178,that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for,Swann's Way
7178,and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into,Swann's Way
7178,"the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a",Swann's Way
7178,"chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about",Swann's Way
7178,"them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no",Swann's Way
7178,"doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter",Swann's Way
7178,the stage of crystallisation.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants.,Swann's Way
7178,"At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current,",Swann's Way
7178,"across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest",Swann's Way
7178,"for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it",Swann's Way
7178,"would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally",Swann's Way
7178,"repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would",Swann's Way
7178,"be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until",Swann's Way
7178,"the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their",Swann's Way
7178,anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called,Swann's Way
7178,"its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before",Swann's Way
7178,"moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after",Swann's Way
7178,"another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims",Swann's Way
7178,"of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt",Swann's Way
7178,"Léonie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle",Swann's Way
7178,"of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always",Swann's Way
7178,retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and,Swann's Way
7178,"eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate",Swann's Way
7178,"its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange,",Swann's Way
7178,"ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily,",Swann's Way
7178,"and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated",Swann's Way
7178,"indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who",Swann's Way
7178,would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from,Swann's Way
7178,"the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him",Swann's Way
7178,"to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a",Swann's Way
7178,"property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of",Swann's Way
7178,"aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was",Swann's Way
7178,here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this,Swann's Way
7178,"point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a",Swann's Way
7178,"background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we",Swann's Way
7178,"were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen",Swann's Way
7178,"in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a",Swann's Way
7178,"floor of Japanese cloisonné. Here and there, on the surface, floated,",Swann's Way
7178,"blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of",Swann's Way
7178,white petals.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy,",Swann's Way
7178,"more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in",Swann's Way
7178,"festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream,",Swann's Way
7178,as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some,Swann's Way
7178,"Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or,Swann's Way
7178,"white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely",Swann's Way
7178,"care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together",Swann's Way
7178,"in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden",Swann's Way
7178,like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over,Swann's Way
7178,the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border,Swann's Way
7178,"also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious,",Swann's Way
7178,"more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless,",Swann's Way
7178,"and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven",Swann's Way
7178,"with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and",Swann's Way
7178,"ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and",Swann's Way
7178,"mystery--with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly.,Swann's Way
7178,"How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free",Swann's Way
7178,"to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched",Swann's Way
7178,"out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it",Swann's Way
7178,"drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly",Swann's Way
7178,"above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,We would sit down among the irises at the water's edge. In the holiday,Swann's Way
7178,"sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed",Swann's Way
7178,"by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with",Swann's Way
7178,an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards,Swann's Way
7178,"we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and",Swann's Way
7178,"chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint,",Swann's Way
7178,"but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire,",Swann's Way
7178,which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed,Swann's Way
7178,"to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all",Swann's Way
7178,"their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes, at the water's edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon",Swann's Way
7178,"a house of the kind called 'pleasure houses,' isolated and lost, seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young",Swann's Way
7178,"woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local",Swann's Way
7178,"origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to",Swann's Way
7178,"bury herself,' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name,",Swann's Way
7178,"and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had",Swann's Way
7178,"been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from",Swann's Way
7178,which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her,Swann's Way
7178,"door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard,",Swann's Way
7178,"through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom,",Swann's Way
7178,"before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they",Swann's Way
7178,"known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their",Swann's Way
7178,"past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have",Swann's Way
7178,occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had,Swann's Way
7178,willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been,Swann's Way
7178,"able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And",Swann's Way
7178,"I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had",Swann's Way
7178,"known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long",Swann's Way
7178,"gloves of a precious, useless charm.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Never, in the course of our walks along the 'Guermantes way,' might",Swann's Way
7178,"we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often",Swann's Way
7178,"thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I",Swann's Way
7178,had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually,Swann's Way
7178,"to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was",Swann's Way
7178,"another fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface, where, according",Swann's Way
7178,"to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that",Swann's Way
7178,"other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I",Swann's Way
7178,"knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse",Swann's Way
7178,"de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually",Swann's Way
7178,"exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself",Swann's Way
7178,"either in tapestry, as was the 'Coronation of Esther' which hung in our",Swann's Way
7178,"church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in",Swann's Way
7178,"his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my",Swann's Way
7178,"fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row",Swann's Way
7178,"of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Geneviève",Swann's Way
7178,"de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern",Swann's Way
7178,sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the,Swann's Way
7178,"ceiling--in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age,",Swann's Way
7178,"and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the",Swann's Way
7178,"resounding syllable 'antes.' And if, in spite of that, they were for",Swann's Way
7178,"me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of",Swann's Way
7178,"an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously",Swann's Way
7178,"distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes",Swann's Way
7178,"of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit 'Guermantes way'",Swann's Way
7178,"of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its",Swann's Way
7178,"overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons.",Swann's Way
7178,And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de,Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain",Swann's Way
7178,"attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first",Swann's Way
7178,"citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among",Swann's Way
7178,"its citizens who did not reside in it--Comtes de Combray, possessing",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it",Swann's Way
7178,"in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that",Swann's Way
7178,strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors,Swann's Way
7178,"of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling,",Swann's Way
7178,"presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like",Swann's Way
7178,"that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of",Swann's Way
7178,"the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer,",Swann's Way
7178,"if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus's for a",Swann's Way
7178,packet of salt.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then it happened that, going the 'Guermantes way,' I passed",Swann's Way
7178,"occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges",Swann's Way
7178,"rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain",Swann's Way
7178,"some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my",Swann's Way
7178,eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much,Swann's Way
7178,to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my,Swann's Way
7178,"favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its",Swann's Way
7178,"imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I",Swann's Way
7178,heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and,Swann's Way
7178,fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream,Swann's Way
7178,"that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself,",Swann's Way
7178,"invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my",Swann's Way
7178,"side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by",Swann's Way
7178,"the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers",Swann's Way
7178,"that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls,",Swann's Way
7178,"and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all",Swann's Way
7178,about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me,Swann's Way
7178,"that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to",Swann's Way
7178,decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked,Swann's Way
7178,"myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I",Swann's Way
7178,"could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind",Swann's Way
7178,"would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would",Swann's Way
7178,"feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a",Swann's Way
7178,malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would,Swann's Way
7178,"depend upon my father's arranging everything for me. He was so powerful,",Swann's Way
7178,"in such favour with the people who 'really counted,' that he made it",Swann's Way
7178,possible for us to transgress laws which Françoise had taught me to,Swann's Way
7178,"regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we",Swann's Way
7178,were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the,Swann's Way
7178,"walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris,",Swann's Way
7178,or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat's,Swann's Way
7178,"son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two",Swann's Way
7178,"months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began",Swann's Way
7178,"with 'A,' instead of having to wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen",Swann's Way
7178,"seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my",Swann's Way
7178,"father's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that",Swann's Way
7178,his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my,Swann's Way
7178,"illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which",Swann's Way
7178,"there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited",Swann's Way
7178,with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable,Swann's Way
7178,"realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health.",Swann's Way
7178,"Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind",Swann's Way
7178,"when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no",Swann's Way
7178,"more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to",Swann's Way
7178,"an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the",Swann's Way
7178,Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of,Swann's Way
7178,"my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient",Swann's Way
7178,"at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life,",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he",Swann's Way
7178,"could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in",Swann's Way
7178,"a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose",Swann's Way
7178,"judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound,",Swann's Way
7178,"helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further",Swann's Way
7178,possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in,Swann's Way
7178,"the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die",Swann's Way
7178,"like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one",Swann's Way
7178,"of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I",Swann's Way
7178,"renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been",Swann's Way
7178,"given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the",Swann's Way
7178,"nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches",Swann's Way
7178,"that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud",Swann's Way
7178,"in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of",Swann's Way
7178,conscience.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One day my mother said: ""You are always talking about Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was",Swann's Way
7178,"ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's",Swann's Way
7178,"wedding. You will be able to see her in church."" It was from Dr.",Swann's Way
7178,"Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper",Swann's Way
7178,in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy,Swann's Way
7178,dress ball given by the Princesse de Léon.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side,",Swann's Way
7178,"enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a",Swann's Way
7178,"large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy",Swann's Way
7178,"and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And",Swann's Way
7178,"because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had",Swann's Way
7178,"been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible,",Swann's Way
7178,"details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because,",Swann's Way
7178,"more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady,",Swann's Way
7178,"if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the",Swann's Way
7178,"same terms:--_a large nose, blue eyes_, as Dr. Percepied had used when",Swann's Way
7178,"describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself:",Swann's Way
7178,"""This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes."" Now the chapel from",Swann's Way
7178,which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath,Swann's Way
7178,"its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb,",Swann's Way
7178,rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having,Swann's Way
7178,"heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family,",Swann's Way
7178,whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there,Swann's Way
7178,"was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes",Swann's Way
7178,"who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there,",Swann's Way
7178,could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was,Swann's Way
7178,"immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of",Swann's Way
7178,"a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being",Swann's Way
7178,of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken,Swann's Way
7178,"into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of,Swann's Way
7178,people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my,Swann's Way
7178,mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative,Swann's Way
7178,"principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in",Swann's Way
7178,"ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain",Swann's Way
7178,"type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and",Swann's Way
7178,"tradesmen. ""It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!"" were",Swann's Way
7178,the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with,Swann's Way
7178,"which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no",Swann's Way
7178,"resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like",Swann's Way
7178,"the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for",Swann's Way
7178,"the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was",Swann's Way
7178,"not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others",Swann's Way
7178,that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous,Swann's Way
7178,"syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery",Swann's Way
7178,"little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her",Swann's Way
7178,"subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the",Swann's Way
7178,"stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger,",Swann's Way
7178,"indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,"whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely",Swann's Way
7178,at a projection of limelight from a lantern.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent",Swann's Way
7178,"nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision",Swann's Way
7178,"(perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the",Swann's Way
7178,"first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder",Swann's Way
7178,whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de,Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: ""It is Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes""; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and",Swann's Way
7178,"the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes,",Swann's Way
7178,with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often,Swann's Way
7178,"dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent",Swann's Way
7178,"of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination,",Swann's Way
7178,"which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different",Swann's Way
7178,"from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me:",Swann's Way
7178,"""Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes",Swann's Way
7178,had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de,Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes descends from Geneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor",Swann's Way
7178,"would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then--oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the",Swann's Way
7178,"human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray,",Swann's Way
7178,"alone, as far as it may choose--while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the",Swann's Way
7178,"chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here",Swann's Way
7178,"and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested",Swann's Way
7178,"upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray",Swann's Way
7178,"of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared",Swann's Way
7178,"conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since",Swann's Way
7178,"she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to",Swann's Way
7178,"notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course",Swann's Way
7178,"of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was",Swann's Way
7178,impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the,Swann's Way
7178,vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before,Swann's Way
7178,"I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for",Swann's Way
7178,years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be,Swann's Way
7178,"desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her",Swann's Way
7178,"I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later",Swann's Way
7178,"reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red",Swann's Way
7178,"cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious,",Swann's Way
7178,"authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now",Swann's Way
7178,"that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face--and",Swann's Way
7178,"especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct",Swann's Way
7178,of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in,Swann's Way
7178,"ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived--I found",Swann's Way
7178,only beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the,Swann's Way
7178,"same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes",Swann's Way
7178,"whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape)",Swann's Way
7178,"apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight,",Swann's Way
7178,"pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound",Swann's Way
7178,"her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation",Swann's Way
7178,"round me: ""She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat"" or ""than Mlle.",Swann's Way
7178,"Vinteuil,"" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And",Swann's Way
7178,"my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her",Swann's Way
7178,"neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of",Swann's Way
7178,"the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this",Swann's Way
7178,"deliberately unfinished sketch: ""How lovely she is! What true nobility!",Swann's Way
7178,"it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant,",Swann's Way
7178,"that I have before me!"" And the care which I took to focus all my",Swann's Way
7178,attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that,Swann's Way
7178,"to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible",Swann's Way
7178,"to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the",Swann's Way
7178,beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the,Swann's Way
7178,"lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite",Swann's Way
7178,"clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the",Swann's Way
7178,"sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy",Swann's Way
7178,"day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all",Swann's Way
7178,"those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose",Swann's Way
7178,"inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in",Swann's Way
7178,"return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might",Swann's Way
7178,count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and,Swann's Way
7178,"natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the",Swann's Way
7178,"deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs,",Swann's Way
7178,"in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague",Swann's Way
7178,thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light,Swann's Way
7178,"which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in",Swann's Way
7178,"any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom",Swann's Way
7178,"that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see",Swann's Way
7178,"again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle",Swann's Way
7178,"astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to",Swann's Way
7178,"address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his",Swann's Way
7178,"share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to",Swann's Way
7178,be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves.,Swann's Way
7178,"This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with",Swann's Way
7178,"my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me",Swann's Way
7178,"during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the",Swann's Way
7178,"window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, ""Of course, she is thinking",Swann's Way
7178,"about me."" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she",Swann's Way
7178,"would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account.",Swann's Way
7178,"And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to",Swann's Way
7178,"make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed",Swann's Way
7178,"Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours,",Swann's Way
7178,"it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet",Swann's Way
7178,"dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind",Swann's Way
7178,a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the,Swann's Way
7178,"Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet",Swann's Way
7178,"laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly",Swann's Way
7178,"advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a",Swann's Way
7178,"bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness",Swann's Way
7178,"in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages",Swann's Way
7178,"of _Lohengrin_, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand",Swann's Way
7178,how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet,Swann's Way
7178,'delicious.',Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the",Swann's Way
7178,"'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect",Swann's Way
7178,"on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must",Swann's Way
7178,abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I,Swann's Way
7178,"felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself,",Swann's Way
7178,"made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of",Swann's Way
7178,"its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased",Swann's Way
7178,"entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on",Swann's Way
7178,"which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart",Swann's Way
7178,"from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment",Swann's Way
7178,"to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a",Swann's Way
7178,"stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the",Swann's Way
7178,"special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they",Swann's Way
7178,"appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something",Swann's Way
7178,"which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which,",Swann's Way
7178,"despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the",Swann's Way
7178,"mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front",Swann's Way
7178,"of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with",Swann's Way
7178,my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten,Swann's Way
7178,"after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to",Swann's Way
7178,recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon,Swann's Way
7178,"recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which,",Swann's Way
7178,"without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming,",Swann's Way
7178,"ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were",Swann's Way
7178,themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any,Swann's Way
7178,impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost,Swann's Way
7178,"of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them",Swann's Way
7178,was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual,Swann's Way
7178,"value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an",Swann's Way
7178,"unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and",Swann's Way
7178,"in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own",Swann's Way
7178,impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme,Swann's Way
7178,for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my,Swann's Way
7178,conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour--to strive,Swann's Way
7178,"for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never",Swann's Way
7178,long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an,Swann's Way
7178,effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck,Swann's Way
7178,"would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my",Swann's Way
7178,"researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter",Swann's Way
7178,"until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no",Swann's Way
7178,purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay,Swann's Way
7178,"hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was",Swann's Way
7178,"taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering,",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days",Swann's Way
7178,"when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my",Swann's Way
7178,"basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once",Swann's Way
7178,"in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my",Swann's Way
7178,mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had,Swann's Way
7178,"gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me)",Swann's Way
7178,"with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a",Swann's Way
7178,"roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass",Swann's Way
7178,"of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality",Swann's Way
7178,"of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the",Swann's Way
7178,"energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had",Swann's Way
7178,"prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very",Swann's Way
7178,"glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening,",Swann's Way
7178,"Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and",Swann's Way
7178,"recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an",Swann's Way
7178,impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first,Swann's Way
7178,subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set,Swann's Way
7178,"on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because",Swann's Way
7178,"the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at",Swann's Way
7178,"Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked",Swann's Way
7178,"us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that",Swann's Way
7178,"special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught",Swann's Way
7178,"sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was",Swann's Way
7178,"playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a,Swann's Way
7178,"third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them",Swann's Way
7178,"by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the",Swann's Way
7178,"distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes",Swann's Way
7178,"of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not",Swann's Way
7178,"penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay",Swann's Way
7178,"behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at",Swann's Way
7178,once to contain and to conceal.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so",Swann's Way
7178,"little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we",Swann's Way
7178,drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for,Swann's Way
7178,"the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and",Swann's Way
7178,the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me,Swann's Way
7178,irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging,Swann's Way
7178,"lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of",Swann's Way
7178,"them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples",Swann's Way
7178,"would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and",Swann's Way
7178,scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the,Swann's Way
7178,"obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring",Swann's Way
7178,them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we,Swann's Way
7178,were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I,Swann's Way
7178,"climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more,",Swann's Way
7178,"at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse",Swann's Way
7178,"at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged,",Swann's Way
7178,"in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to",Swann's Way
7178,recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and,Swann's Way
7178,"their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were",Swann's Way
7178,stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became,Swann's Way
7178,apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a,Swann's Way
7178,"moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,"with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much",Swann's Way
7178,"enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer",Swann's Way
7178,"think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled",Swann's Way
7178,"a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them",Swann's Way
7178,"again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few",Swann's Way
7178,minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they,Swann's Way
7178,"shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of,Swann's Way
7178,"Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it",Swann's Way
7178,was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to,Swann's Way
7178,"me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed,",Swann's Way
7178,"in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to",Swann's Way
7178,"satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since",Swann's Way
7178,"discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and",Swann's Way
7178,there.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in",Swann's Way
7178,"that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of",Swann's Way
7178,Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting,Swann's Way
7178,"them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq,",Swann's Way
7178,"was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and",Swann's Way
7178,"yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like",Swann's Way
7178,"three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in",Swann's Way
7178,"the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper",Swann's Way
7178,"distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by",Swann's Way
7178,"the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could",Swann's Way
7178,see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in,Swann's Way
7178,approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse,Swann's Way
7178,"before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having",Swann's Way
7178,"turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung",Swann's Way
7178,themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop,Swann's Way
7178,before being dashed against the porch of the church.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already",Swann's Way
7178,"disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight,",Swann's Way
7178,"its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of",Swann's Way
7178,"farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw,",Swann's Way
7178,so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road,Swann's Way
7178,"changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots,",Swann's Way
7178,"and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already",Swann's Way
7178,"close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them",Swann's Way
7178,"for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers",Swann's Way
7178,"painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think,",Swann's Way
7178,"too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over",Swann's Way
7178,which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a,Swann's Way
7178,"gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some",Swann's Way
7178,"awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close",Swann's Way
7178,"to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more,",Swann's Way
7178,"now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and",Swann's Way
7178,"resigned, and so vanishing in the night.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my",Swann's Way
7178,"corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit",Swann's Way
7178,"of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville",Swann's Way
7178,"market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness,",Swann's Way
7178,felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the,Swann's Way
7178,"steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I",Swann's Way
7178,"myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top",Swann's Way
7178,of my voice.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the",Swann's Way
7178,pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de,Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the",Swann's Way
7178,"Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in",Swann's Way
7178,"such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous",Swann's Way
7178,"afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need",Swann's Way
7178,"only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of",Swann's Way
7178,"orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees",Swann's Way
7178,"which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun,",Swann's Way
7178,"the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would",Swann's Way
7178,"begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at",Swann's Way
7178,"home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the",Swann's Way
7178,"'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than",Swann's Way
7178,"usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so",Swann's Way
7178,"that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to",Swann's Way
7178,"dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone",Swann's Way
7178,of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other,Swann's Way
7178,"zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as",Swann's Way
7178,"sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line",Swann's Way
7178,"invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird",Swann's Way
7178,"flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it,",Swann's Way
7178,enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just,Swann's Way
7178,"now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of",Swann's Way
7178,happiness--I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would,Swann's Way
7178,have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them,Swann's Way
7178,"all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma!",Swann's Way
7178,"Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my",Swann's Way
7178,"mother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where",Swann's Way
7178,"I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that",Swann's Way
7178,"I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when,",Swann's Way
7178,"the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might",Swann's Way
7178,"lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which",Swann's Way
7178,"clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run",Swann's Way
7178,"down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening",Swann's Way
7178,"must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so",Swann's Way
7178,it was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between,Swann's Way
7178,"these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain",Swann's Way
7178,"periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one",Swann's Way
7178,returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and,Swann's Way
7178,"ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means",Swann's Way
7178,"of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the",Swann's Way
7178,other.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,So the 'Méséglise way' and the 'Guermantes way' remain for me linked,Swann's Way
7178,with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives,Swann's Way
7178,"along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in",Swann's Way
7178,"sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of",Swann's Way
7178,"the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the",Swann's Way
7178,"truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have",Swann's Way
7178,"opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for",Swann's Way
7178,their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us,Swann's Way
7178,"those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became",Swann's Way
7178,"apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water",Swann's Way
7178,"which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as",Swann's Way
7178,environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still,Swann's Way
7178,"with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were",Swann's Way
7178,"slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming",Swann's Way
7178,child--as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the,Swann's Way
7178,"crowd--that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose",Swann's Way
7178,that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in,Swann's Way
7178,all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which,Swann's Way
7178,"strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the",Swann's Way
7178,"dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no",Swann's Way
7178,"echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by",Swann's Way
7178,"the current, and formed only to burst--my exaltation of mind has borne",Swann's Way
7178,"them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these",Swann's Way
7178,"successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have",Swann's Way
7178,"vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of",Swann's Way
7178,"those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment",Swann's Way
7178,of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in,Swann's Way
7178,such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my,Swann's Way
7178,"mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from",Swann's Way
7178,"what place, from what time--perhaps, quite simply, from which of my",Swann's Way
7178,dreams--it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my,Swann's Way
7178,"mental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard",Swann's Way
7178,the Méséglise and Guermantes 'ways.' It is because I used to think of,Swann's Way
7178,"certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that",Swann's Way
7178,"the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone,",Swann's Way
7178,"I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith",Swann's Way
7178,"which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape",Swann's Way
7178,"in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the",Swann's Way
7178,first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The 'Méséglise way',Swann's Way
7178,"with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its",Swann's Way
7178,"apple-trees, the 'Guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles, its",Swann's Way
7178,"water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time",Swann's Way
7178,"the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my",Swann's Way
7178,"only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat,",Swann's Way
7178,"see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among",Swann's Way
7178,"the cornfields--as Saint-André-des-Champs lay hidden--an old church,",Swann's Way
7178,"monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers,",Swann's Way
7178,"the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to",Swann's Way
7178,"encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And",Swann's Way
7178,"yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am",Swann's Way
7178,"seized with a desire to see again the 'Guermantes way,' it would not",Swann's Way
7178,be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies,Swann's Way
7178,"as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my",Swann's Way
7178,"return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that",Swann's Way
7178,"anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of",Swann's Way
7178,"love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have",Swann's Way
7178,"wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me,",Swann's Way
7178,though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No:,Swann's Way
7178,just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that,Swann's Way
7178,"untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able",Swann's Way
7178,"to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes",Swann's Way
7178,"in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her",Swann's Way
7178,"kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation,",Swann's Way
7178,unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my,Swann's Way
7178,"mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which",Swann's Way
7178,"there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish,",Swann's Way
7178,and which I loved as much as all the rest--so what I want to see again,Swann's Way
7178,"is the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little",Swann's Way
7178,"apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the",Swann's Way
7178,"entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it",Swann's Way
7178,"is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined",Swann's Way
7178,the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality,Swann's Way
7178,"sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost",Swann's Way
7178,"fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in",Swann's Way
7178,"me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had",Swann's Way
7178,"made me feel several separate things at the same time, the Méséglise",Swann's Way
7178,"and Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much",Swann's Way
7178,"disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to",Swann's Way
7178,see a person again without realising that it was simply because that,Swann's Way
7178,person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been,Swann's Way
7178,"led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of",Swann's Way
7178,"affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by",Swann's Way
7178,"the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions,",Swann's Way
7178,"to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to",Swann's Way
7178,"those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the",Swann's Way
7178,"rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for",Swann's Way
7178,"me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a",Swann's Way
7178,"tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the",Swann's Way
7178,"'Méséglise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling,",Swann's Way
7178,"through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent",Swann's Way
7178,lilac-trees.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at",Swann's Way
7178,"Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days",Swann's Way
7178,"besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the",Swann's Way
7178,taste--by what would have been called at Combray the 'perfume'---of a,Swann's Way
7178,"cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many",Swann's Way
7178,"years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love",Swann's Way
7178,affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that,Swann's Way
7178,"accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are",Swann's Way
7178,studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when,Swann's Way
7178,"we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an",Swann's Way
7178,accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible,Swann's Way
7178,"to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance",Swann's Way
7178,"by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories,",Swann's Way
7178,"following one after another, were condensed into a single substance,",Swann's Way
7178,but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the,Swann's Way
7178,"three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others,",Swann's Way
7178,"inspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume,' and those which were",Swann's Way
7178,"actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at",Swann's Way
7178,"second hand--no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least",Swann's Way
7178,"those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain",Swann's Way
7178,"marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the",Swann's Way
7178,"brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I",Swann's Way
7178,"was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in",Swann's Way
7178,"the darkness, and--fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the",Swann's Way
7178,assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed,Swann's Way
7178,the curtains and the window--would have reconstructed it complete and,Swann's Way
7178,"with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working",Swann's Way
7178,"upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have",Swann's Way
7178,replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed,Swann's Way
7178,site. But scarcely had daylight itself--and no longer the gleam from,Swann's Way
7178,"a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for",Swann's Way
7178,"daylight--traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across",Swann's Way
7178,"a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with",Swann's Way
7178,"its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had",Swann's Way
7178,"erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table,",Swann's Way
7178,"which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would",Swann's Way
7178,"hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and",Swann's Way

7178,"the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a",Swann's Way
7178,"lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their",Swann's Way

7178,"whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he",Swann's Way

7178,where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken,Swann's Way
7178,"his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in",Swann's Way

7178,"life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally",Swann's Way
7178,prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had,Swann's Way
7178,"squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had",Swann's Way
7178,made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society,Swann's Way

7178,"distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there",Swann's Way
7178,with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the,Swann's Way
7178,"women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom",Swann's Way
7178,"he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as",Swann's Way
7178,"often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for",Swann's Way
7178,"the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without",Swann's Way
7178,"reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women",Swann's Way
7178,"painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or",Swann's Way
7178,"a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which",Swann's Way
7178,"would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy",Swann's Way
7178,human flesh.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct,Swann's Way
7178,"for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his",Swann's Way
7178,"eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his",Swann's Way
7178,"'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to",Swann's Way
7178,substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in,Swann's Way
7178,her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come,Swann's Way
7178,"and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the",Swann's Way
7178,"face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if,",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in",Swann's Way
7178,his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself,Swann's Way
7178,"in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so",Swann's Way
7178,as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman,Swann's Way
7178,"might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers",Swann's Way
7178,carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could,Swann's Way
7178,"not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless,",Swann's Way
7178,however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit,Swann's Way
7178,"with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to",Swann's Way
7178,"do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been",Swann's Way
7178,"squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly",Swann's Way
7178,"worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him",Swann's Way
7178,in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in,Swann's Way
7178,"the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust",Swann's Way
7178,"of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for",Swann's Way
7178,"it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an",Swann's Way
7178,element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent,Swann's Way
7178,"men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their",Swann's Way
7178,"intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could",Swann's Way
7178,"be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations",Swann's Way
7178,more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written.,Swann's Way
7178,"So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the",Swann's Way
7178,"more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the",Swann's Way
7178,"Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling",Swann's Way
7178,"adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the",Swann's Way
7178,"train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was",Swann's Way
7178,"the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself",Swann's Way
7178,"kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity",Swann's Way
7178,"of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave",Swann's Way
7178,was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of,Swann's Way
7178,somebody's cook.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann",Swann's Way
7178,compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends,Swann's Way
7178,"were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on",Swann's Way
7178,"them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic",Swann's Way
7178,"adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs'",Swann's Way
7178,"and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest",Swann's Way
7178,"indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest.",Swann's Way
7178,"I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to",Swann's Way

7178,"latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would",Swann's Way
7178,"exclaim: ""Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!"" And, either",Swann's Way
7178,from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us,Swann's Way
7178,"to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would",Swann's Way
7178,"meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers,",Swann's Way
7178,as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us,Swann's Way
7178,"every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her,",Swann's Way
7178,"to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering,",Swann's Way
7178,"all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often",Swann's Way
7178,"failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins,Swann's Way
7178,"of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly,",Swann's Way
7178,"and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be",Swann's Way
7178,"ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him",Swann's Way
7178,"when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had",Swann's Way
7178,left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he,Swann's Way
7178,was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The,Swann's Way
7178,"cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations",Swann's Way
7178,she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary,Swann's Way
7178,to inform.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at",Swann's Way
7178,"least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular",Swann's Way
7178,"that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for",Swann's Way
7178,"her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in",Swann's Way
7178,"which she moved or into which he had drawn her. ""No good depending on",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann for this evening,"" people would say; ""don't you remember, it's his",Swann's Way
7178,"American's night at the Opera?"" He would secure invitations for her to",Swann's Way
7178,"the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself",Swann's Way
7178,"went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after",Swann's Way
7178,a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered,Swann's Way
7178,"with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would",Swann's Way
7178,select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at,Swann's Way
7178,"the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking",Swann's Way
7178,"of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he",Swann's Way
7178,"always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there,",Swann's Way
7178,"lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would",Swann's Way
7178,find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown,Swann's Way
7178,"weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the",Swann's Way
7178,"flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him",Swann's Way
7178,"beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been",Swann's Way
7178,"the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of",Swann's Way
7178,"a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on",Swann's Way
7178,"his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at",Swann's Way
7178,"the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crécy by an old friend of",Swann's Way
7178,"his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom",Swann's Way
7178,he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out,Swann's Way
7178,"to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be",Swann's Way
7178,conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style",Swann's Way
7178,"of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire,",Swann's Way
7178,"which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those",Swann's Way
7178,"women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different",Swann's Way
7178,"examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To",Swann's Way
7178,"give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate,",Swann's Way
7178,"her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes",Swann's Way
7178,"were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own",Swann's Way
7178,"weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell",Swann's Way
7178,or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre,Swann's Way
7178,"she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections,",Swann's Way
7178,"which would interest her so much, she, ""an ignorant woman with a taste",Swann's Way
7178,"for beautiful things,"" saying that she would know him better when",Swann's Way
7178,"once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be ""so",Swann's Way
7178,"comfortable with his tea and his books""; although she had not concealed",Swann's Way
7178,"her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so",Swann's Way
7178,"depressing, and was ""not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.""",Swann's Way
7178,And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how,Swann's Way
7178,sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she,Swann's Way
7178,"was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he",Swann's Way
7178,"had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew,",Swann's Way
7178,and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond,Swann's Way
7178,"which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with",Swann's Way
7178,"disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content",Swann's Way
7178,himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting,Swann's Way
7178,"too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in",Swann's Way
7178,"early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still",Swann's Way
7178,is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well,Swann's Way
7178,become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger,Swann's Way
7178,days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves;,Swann's Way
7178,"later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough",Swann's Way
7178,"to make him fall in love with her. And so, at an age when it would",Swann's Way
7178,appear--since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective,Swann's Way
7178,pleasure--that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part,Swann's Way
7178,"in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical",Swann's Way
7178,"order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has",Swann's Way
7178,already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer,Swann's Way
7178,"evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws,",Swann's Way
7178,before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify,Swann's Way
7178,it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we,Swann's Way
7178,"recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on",Swann's Way
7178,"our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the",Swann's Way
7178,"opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for",Swann's Way
7178,"us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where",Swann's Way
7178,"it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are",Swann's Way
7178,well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow,Swann's Way
7178,"our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette de Crécy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent,",Swann's Way
7178,and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he,Swann's Way
7178,felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in,Swann's Way
7178,"the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite",Swann's Way
7178,"of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to",Swann's Way
7178,"him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he",Swann's Way
7178,spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared,Swann's Way
7178,"thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead",Swann's Way
7178,"and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface,",Swann's Way
7178,"were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period,",Swann's Way
7178,"drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray",Swann's Way
7178,"locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably",Swann's Way
7178,"built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of",Swann's Way
7178,"the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the",Swann's Way
7178,"best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an",Swann's Way
7178,"arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point,",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman,",Swann's Way
7178,"that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly",Swann's Way
7178,"fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the",Swann's Way
7178,"inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the",Swann's Way
7178,"fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line",Swann's Way
7178,"which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of",Swann's Way
7178,"vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere",Swann's Way
7178,"attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the",Swann's Way
7178,architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her,Swann's Way
7178,"own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely",Swann's Way
7178,buried.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her",Swann's Way
7178,telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again;,Swann's Way
7178,"he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him",Swann's Way
7178,"that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at",Swann's Way
7178,"him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her",Swann's Way
7178,a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in,Swann's Way
7178,"the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black",Swann's Way
7178,"velvet. ""And won't you,"" she had ventured, ""come just once and take tea",Swann's Way
7178,"with me?"" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay--which, in reality,",Swann's Way
7178,"he had abandoned years ago--on Vermeer of Delft. ""I know that I am quite",Swann's Way
7178,"useless,"" she had replied, ""a little wild thing like me beside a learned",Swann's Way
7178,great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I,Swann's Way
7178,"should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun",Swann's Way
7178,"it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of",Swann's Way
7178,"old papers!"" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart",Swann's Way
7178,woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself,Swann's Way
7178,"up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as",Swann's Way
7178,"cooking the dinner, with her ""hands right in the dish itself."" ""You will",Swann's Way
7178,"only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,"" she",Swann's Way

7178,"on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel",Swann's Way
7178,sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing",Swann's Way
7178,"else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!"" she",Swann's Way

7178,to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like--to,Swann's Way
7178,"introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my",Swann's Way

7178,"the little Verdurins.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,who had taken Swann to the house.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his",Swann's Way
7178,"first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,",Swann's Way
7178,"and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course",Swann's Way
7178,"of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to,Swann's Way
7178,"reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or",Swann's Way
7178,in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial,Swann's Way
7178,"expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose",Swann's Way
7178,expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a,Swann's Way
7178,"simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been",Swann's Way
7178,"facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he",Swann's Way
7178,"never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features,",Swann's Way
7178,"and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which",Swann's Way
7178,"you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: ""Do you",Swann's Way
7178,"really mean that?"" He was no more confident of the manner in which he",Swann's Way
7178,"ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally,",Swann's Way
7178,"than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by,",Swann's Way
7178,"carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which",Swann's Way
7178,"absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved,",Swann's Way
7178,"if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware",Swann's Way
7178,"of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of",Swann's Way
7178,his own.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to",Swann's Way
7178,"be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate",Swann's Way
7178,the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his,Swann's Way
7178,education.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his",Swann's Way
7178,"first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never",Swann's Way
7178,let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him,Swann's Way
7178,without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for",Swann's Way
7178,"knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than",Swann's Way
7178,"was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended",Swann's Way
7178,"by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue",Swann's Way
7178,"blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion,",Swann's Way
7178,"'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in",Swann's Way
7178,what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in,Swann's Way
7178,"conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other",Swann's Way
7178,'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of,Swann's Way
7178,"strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat",Swann's Way
7178,"them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice",Swann's Way
7178,to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided",Swann's Way
7178,"himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good",Swann's Way
7178,breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in,Swann's Way
7178,"any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself",Swann's Way
7178,"that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that",Swann's Way
7178,he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his,Swann's Way
7178,"faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued",Swann's Way
7178,"to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to",Swann's Way
7178,"see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely:",Swann's Way
7178,"""It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure",Swann's Way
7178,"you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're",Swann's Way
7178,"rather too near the stage,"" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a",Swann's Way
7178,smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face,Swann's Way
7178,until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the,Swann's Way
7178,"spectacle, replied: ""To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and",Swann's Way
7178,one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that,Swann's Way
7178,"I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be",Swann's Way
7178,"able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you,",Swann's Way
7178,"you are so good."" And he went on, ""Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they",Swann's Way
7178,"call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the",Swann's Way
7178,"boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?"" in the hope of an",Swann's Way
7178,"enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""D'you know,"" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, ""I believe we are",Swann's Way
7178,going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the,Swann's Way
7178,Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday,Swann's Way
7178,"existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he",Swann's Way
7178,"accepts everything that we say as gospel.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I never dared to mention it,"" M. Verdurin had answered, ""but I've",Swann's Way
7178,"noticed the same thing myself."" And on the following New Year's Day,",Swann's Way
7178,"instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs,",Swann's Way
7178,"and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an",Swann's Way
7178,"artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was",Swann's Way
7178,something almost impossible to match.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that,Swann's Way
7178,"evening; ""Swann!"" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal",Swann's Way
7178,"by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take",Swann's Way
7178,utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in,Swann's Way
7178,"readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, ""Swann! Who",Swann's Way
7178,"on earth is Swann?"" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided",Swann's Way
7178,"as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, ""Why, Odette's friend, whom she",Swann's Way
7178,"told us about.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" answered the Doctor, at once",Swann's Way
7178,"mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in",Swann's Way
7178,"love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings.",Swann's Way
7178,"""Nothing amuses me more than match-making,"" he confided to Cottard; ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"have been tremendously successful, even with women!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had",Swann's Way
7178,"alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived,",Swann's Way
7178,"however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,",Swann's Way
7178,"though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society.",Swann's Way
7178,"He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and",Swann's Way
7178,"moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and",Swann's Way
7178,"refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer",Swann's Way
7178,see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills,Swann's Way
7178,"the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature,",Swann's Way
7178,freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming,Swann's Way
7178,"too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of",Swann's Way
7178,movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out,Swann's Way
7178,precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation,Swann's Way
7178,by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a,Swann's Way
7178,man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown,Swann's Way
7178,"youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before",Swann's Way
7178,"the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded,",Swann's Way
7178,"without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social",Swann's Way
7178,"deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his",Swann's Way
7178,"own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an",Swann's Way
7178,"assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their",Swann's Way
7178,"'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only,",Swann's Way
7178,on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous,Swann's Way
7178,"smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which",Swann's Way
7178,"Cottard styled ""letting 'em all come""), Swann supposed that the Doctor",Swann's Way
7178,"recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some",Swann's Way
7178,"house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited,",Swann's Way
7178,never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love.,Swann's Way
7178,"Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann",Swann's Way
7178,assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to,Swann's Way
7178,"the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would",Swann's Way
7178,"not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to",Swann's Way
7178,"amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's",Swann's Way
7178,expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at,Swann's Way
7178,"once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him",Swann's Way
7178,"very pleasant. ""Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have",Swann's Way
7178,"been,"" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,",Swann's Way
7178,"""perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait"" (for which she",Swann's Way
7178,"had given the painter a commission). ""Take care, Master Biche,"" she",Swann's Way
7178,"reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address",Swann's Way
7178,"as 'Master,' ""to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little",Swann's Way
7178,"twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's",Swann's Way
7178,"what I've asked you to paint--the portrait of his smile."" And since the",Swann's Way
7178,"phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to",Swann's Way
7178,"make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and",Swann's Way
7178,even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer,Swann's Way
7178,"before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone,",Swann's Way
7178,"even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness,",Swann's Way
7178,simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due,Swann's Way
7178,"to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished",Swann's Way
7178,"family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with",Swann's Way
7178,a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it,Swann's Way
7178,"indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul,",Swann's Way
7178,as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never,Swann's Way
7178,wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce,Swann's Way
7178,seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By,Swann's Way
7178,"asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse",Swann's Way
7178,"the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the",Swann's Way
7178,"distinction: ""M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette"")",Swann's Way
7178,"but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which,",Swann's Way
7178,"however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather",Swann's Way
7178,"annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends.",Swann's Way
7178,On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next,Swann's Way
7178,"request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's",Swann's Way
7178,"aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she",Swann's Way
7178,"believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing",Swann's Way
7178,"could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as",Swann's Way
7178,it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with,Swann's Way
7178,"deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was",Swann's Way
7178,"entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and",Swann's Way
7178,"pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling",Swann's Way
7178,"manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in",Swann's Way
7178,the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had,Swann's Way
7178,actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of,Swann's Way
7178,"continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare",Swann's Way
7178,"intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive.",Swann's Way
7178,Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in,Swann's Way
7178,"conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""She is such an excellent woman!"" he rejoined. ""I grant you that she",Swann's Way
7178,is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most,Swann's Way
7178,"charmingly when you are alone with her.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I am sure she can,"" Swann hastened to conciliate him. ""All I meant was",Swann's Way
7178,"that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'"" he went on, isolating",Swann's Way
7178,"the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, ""and, after all, that is",Swann's Way
7178,"something of a compliment.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Wait a moment,"" said M. Verdurin, ""now, this will surprise you; she",Swann's Way
7178,writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is,Swann's Way
7178,"admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something,",Swann's Way
7178,"M. Swann?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I should count myself most fortunate..."" Swann was beginning, a trifle",Swann's Way
7178,"pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it",Swann's Way
7178,"said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis",Swann's Way
7178,"and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a",Swann's Way
7178,"solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just",Swann's Way
7178,"now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately",Swann's Way
7178,"pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in",Swann's Way
7178,"what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be",Swann's Way
7178,"in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole",Swann's Way
7178,"thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the",Swann's Way
7178,"quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended",Swann's Way
7178,"to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his",Swann's Way
7178,mind.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Most fortunate for France!"" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms",Swann's Way
7178,with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign",Swann's Way
7178,"of brooding melancholy down in your corner,"" shouted Mme. Verdurin. ""You",Swann's Way
7178,don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on,Swann's Way
7178,"the stool of repentance,"" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,",Swann's Way
7178,"which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in",Swann's Way
7178,"her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,'",Swann's Way
7178,"and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture",Swann's Way
7178,which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the,Swann's Way
7178,presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time,Swann's Way
7178,"to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there",Swann's Way
7178,when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine,Swann's Way
7178,"their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of",Swann's Way
7178,"mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually",Swann's Way
7178,"filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens,",Swann's Way
7178,"barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity",Swann's Way
7178,of useless but indestructible objects.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the,Swann's Way
7178,"conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but,",Swann's Way
7178,"since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in",Swann's Way
7178,"real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which",Swann's Way
7178,"signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that",Swann's Way
7178,she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any,Swann's Way
7178,"of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle",Swann's Way
7178,who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'--and to the utter despair,Swann's Way
7178,"of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily",Swann's Way
7178,"amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,'",Swann's Way
7178,"was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished",Swann's Way
7178,by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity--she would utter a,Swann's Way
7178,"shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning",Swann's Way
7178,"to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only",Swann's Way
7178,"just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow,",Swann's Way
7178,"burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and",Swann's Way
7178,"prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be",Swann's Way
7178,"struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give",Swann's Way
7178,"way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with",Swann's Way
7178,"the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and",Swann's Way
7178,"asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird",Swann's Way
7178,"whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob",Swann's Way
7178,with fellow-feeling.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light",Swann's Way
7178,"his pipe (""No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!""), went and",Swann's Way

7178,"each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the",Swann's Way
7178,"seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the",Swann's Way

7178,"attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at",Swann's Way

7178,"little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a",Swann's Way

7178,"After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him",Swann's Way
7178,"than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music",Swann's Way
7178,played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the,Swann's Way
7178,material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it,Swann's Way
7178,"had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the",Swann's Way
7178,"violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole,",Swann's Way
7178,"he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a",Swann's Way
7178,"flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent,",Swann's Way
7178,"level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of",Swann's Way
7178,"the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at",Swann's Way
7178,"a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline,",Swann's Way
7178,"or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had",Swann's Way
7178,"tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony--he",Swann's Way
7178,"knew not which--that had just been played, and had opened and expanded",Swann's Way
7178,"his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist",Swann's Way
7178,"air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was",Swann's Way
7178,owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so,Swann's Way
7178,"confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only",Swann's Way
7178,"purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original,",Swann's Way
7178,"and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order,",Swann's Way
7178,"vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression _sine materia_.",Swann's Way
7178,Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out,Swann's Way
7178,"before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their",Swann's Way
7178,"pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation",Swann's Way
7178,"of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves",Swann's Way
7178,have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to,Swann's Way
7178,"escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous",Swann's Way
7178,notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception,Swann's Way
7178,would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the _motifs_ which now,Swann's Way
7178,"and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and",Swann's Way
7178,drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they,Swann's Way
7178,"instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;--if",Swann's Way
7178,"our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm",Swann's Way
7178,"foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for",Swann's Way
7178,"us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to",Swann's Way
7178,"contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious",Swann's Way
7178,"sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory",Swann's Way
7178,"had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true,",Swann's Way
7178,"and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while",Swann's Way
7178,"the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression",Swann's Way
7178,"suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture",Swann's Way
7178,"to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the",Swann's Way
7178,strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which,Swann's Way
7178,"was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought,",Swann's Way
7178,and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had,Swann's Way
7178,"distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments",Swann's Way
7178,from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to,Swann's Way
7178,"partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he",Swann's Way
7178,"had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could",Swann's Way
7178,"initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and",Swann's Way
7178,strange desire.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,",Swann's Way
7178,"towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly",Swann's Way
7178,"indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which",Swann's Way
7178,"he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it",Swann's Way
7178,"changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform,",Swann's Way
7178,"melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista",Swann's Way
7178,"of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing,",Swann's Way
7178,"that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though",Swann's Way
7178,"without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,"less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he",Swann's Way
7178,"was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment",Swann's Way
7178,"passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and",Swann's Way
7178,"enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether",Swann's Way
7178,"he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing of her, not even her name.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few",Swann's Way
7178,"months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of",Swann's Way
7178,rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards,Swann's Way
7178,"any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral",Swann's Way
7178,"satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally",Swann's Way
7178,"stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in",Swann's Way
7178,"that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his",Swann's Way
7178,"mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe",Swann's Way
7178,in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had,Swann's Way
7178,"grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations,",Swann's Way
7178,which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance.,Swann's Way
7178,Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have,Swann's Way
7178,"done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he",Swann's Way
7178,"had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that",Swann's Way
7178,"afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards",Swann's Way
7178,upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express,Swann's Way
7178,"with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would",Swann's Way
7178,"supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and",Swann's Way
7178,excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely,Swann's Way
7178,"precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and",Swann's Way
7178,"death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he",Swann's Way
7178,"would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or",Swann's Way
7178,"of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words",Swann's Way
7178,"in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself",Swann's Way
7178,"with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all",Swann's Way
7178,"of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of",Swann's Way
7178,"treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself,",Swann's Way
7178,"spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his",Swann's Way
7178,"malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond",Swann's Way
7178,"all hope, of starting to lead--and better late than never--a wholly",Swann's Way
7178,"different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that",Swann's Way
7178,"he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play",Swann's Way
7178,"over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase",Swann's Way
7178,"among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which",Swann's Way
7178,"he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon",Swann's Way
7178,the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative,Swann's Way
7178,"influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of",Swann's Way
7178,"the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out",Swann's Way
7178,"whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been",Swann's Way
7178,"unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the",Swann's Way
7178,"people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them;",Swann's Way
7178,but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was,Swann's Way
7178,"played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another",Swann's Way
7178,"room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer",Swann's Way
7178,"impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a",Swann's Way
7178,recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for,Swann's Way
7178,"the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now",Swann's Way
7178,"on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of",Swann's Way
7178,"course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the",Swann's Way
7178,exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given,Swann's Way
7178,"him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced",Swann's Way
7178,"in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And",Swann's Way
7178,"so, at last, he ceased to think of it.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun",Swann's Way
7178,"to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole",Swann's Way
7178,"bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that",Swann's Way
7178,"resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain",Swann's Way
7178,"of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth--and recognised, secret,",Swann's Way
7178,"whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved.",Swann's Way
7178,"And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met,",Swann's Way
7178,"in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once,",Swann's Way
7178,"in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the",Swann's Way
7178,"phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the",Swann's Way
7178,"wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a",Swann's Way
7178,"reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of",Swann's Way
7178,his fair unknown (and was told that it was the _andante_ movement of,Swann's Way
7178,"Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could",Swann's Way
7178,"have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its",Swann's Way
7178,language and acquire its secret.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and",Swann's Way
7178,thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Isn't he charming?"" she asked Swann, ""doesn't he just understand it,",Swann's Way
7178,"his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano",Swann's Way
7178,"could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in",Swann's Way
7178,it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think,Swann's Way
7178,"I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an",Swann's Way
7178,"orchestra, more complete.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining",Swann's Way
7178,"each of his words as though he were making an epigram: ""You are most",Swann's Way
7178,"generous to me.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, ""Run and fetch him a",Swann's Way
7178,"glass of orangeade; it's well earned!"" Swann began to tell Odette how he",Swann's Way
7178,"had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was",Swann's Way
7178,"a little way off, called out, ""Well! It looks to me as though some one",Swann's Way
7178,"was saying nice things to you, Odette!"" she replied, ""Yes, very",Swann's Way
7178,"nice,"" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some",Swann's Way
7178,"information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what",Swann's Way
7178,period in his life he had composed the sonata;--what meaning the little,Swann's Way
7178,"phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when,Swann's Way
7178,Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had,Swann's Way
7178,"exclaimed, ""I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to",Swann's Way
7178,confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to,Swann's Way
7178,"know it!""--and the painter had gone on with, ""Ah, yes, it's a very fine",Swann's Way
7178,"bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,'",Swann's Way
7178,"something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great",Swann's Way
7178,"impression on us artists.""), none of them seemed ever to have asked",Swann's Way
7178,"himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite,Swann's Way
7178,"phrase, ""D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may",Swann's Way
7178,as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through,Swann's Way
7178,"a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we",Swann's Way
7178,"don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not",Swann's Way
7178,"a habit of ours, that's all,"" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard",Swann's Way
7178,"gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to",Swann's Way
7178,follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another,Swann's Way
7178,"of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard,",Swann's Way
7178,with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble,Swann's Way
7178,"origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend",Swann's Way
7178,"to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once",Swann's Way
7178,"they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could",Swann's Way
7178,understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot,Swann's Way
7178,"recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the",Swann's Way
7178,"stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated,",Swann's Way
7178,"while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so",Swann's Way
7178,"M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were",Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's",Swann's Way
7178,"portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in",Swann's Way
7178,"painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as",Swann's Way
7178,though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which,Swann's Way
7178,bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were,Swann's Way
7178,"accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon",Swann's Way
7178,"his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human",Swann's Way
7178,"form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say",Swann's Way
7178,lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose,Swann's Way
7178,"spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people--real,",Swann's Way
7178,"living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or",Swann's Way
7178,"that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor",Swann's Way
7178,"felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme.",Swann's Way

7178,"exclaimed, with a sudden determination.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata;,Swann's Way

7178,"ghastly.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What!"" cried Mme. Verdurin, ""Do people still call in Potain?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Ah! Mme. Verdurin,"" Cottard simpered, ""you forget that you are speaking",Swann's Way

7178,loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected,Swann's Way
7178,in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as,Swann's Way
7178,"ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work",Swann's Way
7178,"contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion",Swann's Way
7178,"of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so",Swann's Way
7178,insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as,Swann's Way

7178,"Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go",Swann's Way
7178,"to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that",Swann's Way
7178,"they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and",Swann's Way
7178,"more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One",Swann's Way
7178,"evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she",Swann's Way
7178,had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting,Swann's Way
7178,"at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them",Swann's Way
7178,"at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance",Swann's Way
7178,"it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be",Swann's Way
7178,"regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and",Swann's Way
7178,in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg,Swann's Way

7178,effect which his announcement had produced.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Are you often taken like that?"" the painter asked Cottard, with",Swann's Way
7178,mock-seriousness.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: ""Ah,",Swann's Way
7178,"good, good; that's all right, then,"" after which he would shew not the",Swann's Way
7178,"least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the",Swann's Way
7178,"usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point",Swann's Way
7178,his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself,Swann's Way
7178,"was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no",Swann's Way
7178,"honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head",Swann's Way
7178,of the State.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What's that you say? M. Grévy? Do you know M. Grévy?"" he demanded of",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the",Swann's Way
7178,"palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the",Swann's Way
7178,"newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he",Swann's Way
7178,"will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of",Swann's Way
7178,the police infirmary.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). ""Anyhow, he is",Swann's Way
7178,"very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties",Swann's Way
7178,"are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you",Swann's Way
7178,"know; never more than eight at table,"" he went on, trying desperately",Swann's Way
7178,to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the,Swann's Way
7178,President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal",Swann's Way
7178,"interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from",Swann's Way
7178,"M. Grévy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into",Swann's Way
7178,the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at,Swann's Way
7178,"all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at",Swann's Way
7178,the Elysée'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to,Swann's Way
7178,"luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,"" he said, in the tone of",Swann's Way
7178,"a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing",Swann's Way
7178,"your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your",Swann's Way
7178,journey without troubling to examine your luggage.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed,",Swann's Way
7178,"it's very good of you to go to them!"" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded",Swann's Way
7178,"the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded,",Swann's Way
7178,"since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion,",Swann's Way
7178,"which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them",Swann's Way
7178,"'fail.' ""It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there."" A",Swann's Way
7178,note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the,Swann's Way
7178,"number--only eight at table--""Are these luncheons what you would",Swann's Way
7178,"describe as 'intimate'?"" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle",Swann's Way
7178,curiosity as in his linguistic zeal.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French,Swann's Way
7178,Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann,Swann's Way
7178,nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first,Swann's Way
7178,"impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without",Swann's Way
7178,"asking anxiously, ""D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening?",Swann's Way
7178,He is a personal friend of M. Grévy's. I suppose that means he's what,Swann's Way
7178,"you'd call a 'gentleman'?"" He even went to the length of offering Swann",Swann's Way
7178,a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,"" he explained, ""but",Swann's Way
7178,"dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because",Swann's Way
7178,"some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there",Swann's Way
7178,"was the devil to pay.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect",Swann's Way
7178,upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the",Swann's Way

7178,"accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,"" she suggested.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But what about Mme. Verdurin?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or",Swann's Way
7178,"that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""How charming of you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by",Swann's Way
7178,consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other,Swann's Way
7178,"pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire",Swann's Way
7178,that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of,Swann's Way
7178,"satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty",Swann's Way
7178,"that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom",Swann's Way
7178,"he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the",Swann's Way
7178,"first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to",Swann's Way
7178,"call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little",Swann's Way
7178,"girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; Rémi, his",Swann's Way
7178,"coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him",Swann's Way
7178,in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter,Swann's Way
7178,"the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had sent her that morning, said: ""I am furious with you!"" and",Swann's Way
7178,"sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist",Swann's Way
7178,"would play to them--for their two selves, and for no one else--that",Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of",Swann's Way
7178,"their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin",Swann's Way
7178,"part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the",Swann's Way
7178,"foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and--just as in",Swann's Way
7178,"those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a",Swann's Way
7178,long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door--infinitely,Swann's Way
7178,"remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some",Swann's Way
7178,"intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral,",Swann's Way
7178,"interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with",Swann's Way
7178,"simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of",Swann's Way
7178,"its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now",Swann's Way
7178,"discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how",Swann's Way
7178,hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace,Swann's Way
7178,"there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in",Swann's Way
7178,"itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an",Swann's Way
7178,outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked,Swann's Way
7178,"upon the sonata less in its own light--as what it might express, had,",Swann's Way
7178,"in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and",Swann's Way
7178,would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries,Swann's Way
7178,"to come--than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the",Swann's Way
7178,"Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same",Swann's Way
7178,"time, of himself--which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that",Swann's Way
7178,point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of,Swann's Way
7178,"getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of",Swann's Way
7178,"which he still knew no more than this one passage. ""Why do you want the",Swann's Way
7178,"rest?"" she had asked him. ""Our little bit; that's all we need."" He went",Swann's Way
7178,"farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by",Swann's Way
7178,"him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed",Swann's Way
7178,"to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had",Swann's Way
7178,"a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters",Swann's Way
7178,"written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with",Swann's Way
7178,"the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are",Swann's Way
7178,not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of,Swann's Way
7178,a 'lass unparalleled.',Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside,",Swann's Way
7178,"with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as",Swann's Way
7178,"the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover",Swann's Way
7178,that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back,Swann's Way
7178,"as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La Pérouse, behind the",Swann's Way
7178,"Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to",Swann's Way
7178,"demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not",Swann's Way
7178,"so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening,",Swann's Way
7178,"of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other",Swann's Way
7178,"privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a",Swann's Way
7178,"privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had",Swann's Way
7178,"the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself",Swann's Way
7178,"between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in",Swann's Way
7178,"spirit, after he had left her for the night.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage;",Swann's Way
7178,"and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate",Swann's Way
7178,"and murmured ""Till to-morrow, then!"" she turned impulsively from him,",Swann's Way
7178,plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked,Swann's Way
7178,"the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his",Swann's Way
7178,carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during,Swann's Way
7178,"the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it",Swann's Way
7178,"away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk.",Swann's Way

7178,horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was,Swann's Way
7178,"irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been",Swann's Way
7178,"'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this",Swann's Way
7178,"occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink",Swann's Way
7178,"and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars,",Swann's Way
7178,which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter,Swann's Way
7178,"afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which",Swann's Way
7178,left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one,Swann's Way
7178,of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the,Swann's Way
7178,"various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing",Swann's Way
7178,"out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened",Swann's Way
7178,"photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, ""You're",Swann's Way
7178,"not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,"" and",Swann's Way
7178,"with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that",Swann's Way
7178,"some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she",Swann's Way
7178,had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of,Swann's Way
7178,"Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to",Swann's Way
7178,"lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when",Swann's Way
7178,"her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another,",Swann's Way
7178,"the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases)",Swann's Way
7178,burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon,Swann's Way
7178,"so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of",Swann's Way
7178,"this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate,",Swann's Way
7178,"more human--filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of",Swann's Way
7178,"some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a",Swann's Way
7178,standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted,Swann's Way
7178,windows at once revealed and screened from sight--she had kept an eye,Swann's Way
7178,"sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps",Swann's Way
7178,"down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put",Swann's Way
7178,"even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her",Swann's Way
7178,"drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And",Swann's Way
7178,"so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements,",Swann's Way
7178,"scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots,",Swann's Way
7178,"which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants",Swann's Way
7178,should be knocked over--and went across to them now to make sure that he,Swann's Way
7178,had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in,Swann's Way
7178,"the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the",Swann's Way
7178,"cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite",Swann's Way
7178,"flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least",Swann's Way
7178,"like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk",Swann's Way
7178,"or satin. ""It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining",Swann's Way
7178,"of my cloak,"" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of",Swann's Way
7178,"respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished,",Swann's Way
7178,"unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far",Swann's Way
7178,"removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so",Swann's Way
7178,"refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to",Swann's Way
7178,"her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued",Swann's Way
7178,"dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a",Swann's Way
7178,"fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with",Swann's Way
7178,"ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved",Swann's Way
7178,"in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the",Swann's Way
7178,"monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency",Swann's Way
7178,"of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across",Swann's Way
7178,"and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these",Swann's Way
7178,affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her,Swann's Way
7178,"attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had",Swann's Way
7178,"once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and",Swann's Way
7178,"whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing",Swann's Way
7178,"to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired ""Lemon",Swann's Way
7178,"or cream?"" and, on his answering ""Cream, please,"" went on, smiling, ""A",Swann's Way
7178,"cloud!"" And as he pronounced it excellent, ""You see, I know just how you",Swann's Way
7178,"like it."" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to",Swann's Way
7178,"her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some",Swann's Way
7178,"justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures",Swann's Way
7178,"which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must",Swann's Way
7178,"cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go",Swann's Way
7178,"and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in",Swann's Way
7178,"his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's",Swann's Way
7178,"adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: ""What fun",Swann's Way
7178,it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could,Swann's Way
7178,"always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding,",Swann's Way
7178,"a really good cup of tea."" An hour or so later he received a note from",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an",Swann's Way
7178,affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its,Swann's Way
7178,"shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes",Swann's Way
7178,"than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of",Swann's Way
7178,sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house.,Swann's Way
7178,"""Why,"" she wrote, ""did you not forget your heart also? I should never",Swann's Way
7178,"have let you have that back.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little",Swann's Way
7178,"later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to",Swann's Way
7178,"meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he",Swann's Way
7178,"was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and",Swann's Way
7178,"rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of",Swann's Way
7178,"those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when",Swann's Way
7178,"they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute",Swann's Way
7178,"depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and",Swann's Way
7178,one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which,Swann's Way
7178,"she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing",Swann's Way
7178,"a wrapper of mauve _crêpe de Chine_, which draped her bosom, like a",Swann's Way
7178,"mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him,",Swann's Way
7178,"brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one",Swann's Way
7178,"knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without",Swann's Way
7178,"tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended",Swann's Way
7178,"head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when",Swann's Way
7178,"there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to",Swann's Way
7178,"the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one",Swann's Way
7178,of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination,Swann's Way
7178,"in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general",Swann's Way
7178,"characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but",Swann's Way
7178,"rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual",Swann's Way
7178,"features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust",Swann's Way
7178,"of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the",Swann's Way
7178,"slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman",Swann's Way
7178,"Rémi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a",Swann's Way
7178,"portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an",Swann's Way
7178,"outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen",Swann's Way
7178,"eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted,",Swann's Way
7178,"in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of",Swann's Way
7178,"life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find",Swann's Way
7178,"a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his",Swann's Way
7178,perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had,Swann's Way
7178,admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give,Swann's Way
7178,those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness,Swann's Way
7178,"to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far",Swann's Way
7178,succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he,Swann's Way
7178,felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious,Swann's Way
7178,and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and,Swann's Way
7178,"repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had",Swann's Way
7178,retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine,Swann's Way
7178,satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more,Swann's Way
7178,"general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the",Swann's Way
7178,abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern,Swann's Way
7178,"original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be,",Swann's Way
7178,"and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time",Swann's Way
7178,"past, had been receiving--though, indeed, they had come to him rather",Swann's Way
7178,through the channel of his appreciation of music--had enriched his,Swann's Way
7178,"appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity",Swann's Way
7178,"of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his",Swann's Way
7178,"character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the",Swann's Way
7178,"Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving",Swann's Way
7178,"his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the",Swann's Way
7178,actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which,Swann's Way
7178,has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate,Swann's Way
7178,of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her,Swann's Way
7178,"cheeks, and the softness and sweetness--as of carnation-petals--which,",Swann's Way
7178,"he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an",Swann's Way
7178,"embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken",Swann's Way
7178,"threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following",Swann's Way
7178,"the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the",Swann's Way
7178,cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her,Swann's Way
7178,"eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was",Swann's Way
7178,made clearly intelligible.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in,Swann's Way
7178,"her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to",Swann's Way
7178,"recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking",Swann's Way
7178,"of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine",Swann's Way
7178,masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been,Swann's Way
7178,"reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered",Swann's Way
7178,her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his,Swann's Way
7178,"failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the",Swann's Way
7178,"great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his",Swann's Way
7178,pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own,Swann's Way
7178,"system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not,",Swann's Way
7178,"as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient",Swann's Way
7178,"of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in",Swann's Way
7178,herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He,Swann's Way
7178,failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply",Swann's Way
7178,because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The,Swann's Way
7178,words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him,Swann's Way
7178,"(gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been",Swann's Way
7178,"debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And",Swann's Way
7178,"whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his",Swann's Way
7178,"misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her",Swann's Way
7178,"beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept",Swann's Way
7178,away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of,Swann's Way
7178,"her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss,",Swann's Way
7178,the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately,Swann's Way
7178,"attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered",Swann's Way
7178,"flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his",Swann's Way
7178,"adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as",Swann's Way
7178,exquisite as they would be supernatural.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was",Swann's Way
7178,not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an,Swann's Way
7178,"inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different,",Swann's Way
7178,"an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would",Swann's Way
7178,"contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind",Swann's Way
7178,"of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual",Swann's Way
7178,thrill of a collector.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a",Swann's Way
7178,"photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would",Swann's Way
7178,"gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the",Swann's Way
7178,"imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair",Swann's Way
7178,"that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt",Swann's Way
7178,"to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman,",Swann's Way
7178,he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated,Swann's Way
7178,"himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might,",Swann's Way
7178,"ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a",Swann's Way
7178,"spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh",Swann's Way
7178,"and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than",Swann's Way
7178,"compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms",Swann's Way
7178,had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time,Swann's Way
7178,"gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli,",Swann's Way
7178,"who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him",Swann's Way
7178,the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette,Swann's Way
7178,against his heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains",Swann's Way
7178,"to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that,",Swann's Way
7178,"since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer",Swann's Way
7178,"to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid",Swann's Way
7178,"lest the manner--at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly",Swann's Way
7178,unalterable--which she now adopted when they were together should,Swann's Way
7178,"ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when",Swann's Way
7178,"she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become",Swann's Way
7178,"and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral",Swann's Way
7178,"aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing",Swann's Way
7178,"weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and",Swann's Way
7178,"feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her",Swann's Way
7178,"before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she",Swann's Way
7178,"would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at",Swann's Way
7178,"her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard",Swann's Way
7178,her utter: and he was right--by repeating this device he had won from,Swann's Way
7178,"her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one",Swann's Way
7178,of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from,Swann's Way
7178,the Maison Dorée--it was the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête given for,Swann's Way
7178,"the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning ""My dear, my hand",Swann's Way
7178,"trembles so that I can scarcely write----""; and these letters he had",Swann's Way
7178,"kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she",Swann's Way
7178,"had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would",Swann's Way
7178,"come running up to him with an ""I've something to say to you!"" and he",Swann's Way
7178,would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what,Swann's Way
7178,she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the",Swann's Way
7178,"great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were",Swann's Way
7178,"never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming",Swann's Way
7178,"creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that",Swann's Way
7178,"golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp",Swann's Way
7178,"and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those",Swann's Way
7178,little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a,Swann's Way
7178,"glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try",Swann's Way
7178,"to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking,",Swann's Way
7178,his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin,Swann's Way
7178,"said to the painter: ""H'm. Seems to be getting warm."" Indeed, her",Swann's Way
7178,presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited,Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which",Swann's Way
7178,ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his,Swann's Way
7178,heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism,",Swann's Way
7178,"namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of",Swann's Way
7178,"daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to",Swann's Way
7178,"the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing",Swann's Way
7178,"which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written",Swann's Way
7178,"to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and",Swann's Way
7178,accompany her home.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark",Swann's Way

7178,"Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at",Swann's Way
7178,"the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing",Swann's Way
7178,"that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare",Swann's Way
7178,"of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the",Swann's Way
7178,sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began,Swann's Way
7178,"then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that",Swann's Way
7178,"certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of",Swann's Way

7178,"always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though",Swann's Way
7178,she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which,Swann's Way
7178,she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable,Swann's Way
7178,word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose',Swann's Way

7178,believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he,Swann's Way
7178,lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted,Swann's Way

7178,"might be a great deal less charming if she were.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been",Swann's Way
7178,"somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked",Swann's Way
7178,by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she,Swann's Way
7178,would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prévost's on her,Swann's Way
7178,"way home. Swann set off at once for Prévost's, but every few yards",Swann's Way
7178,"his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street,",Swann's Way
7178,loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath,Swann's Way
7178,"his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would",Swann's Way
7178,delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He,Swann's Way
7178,"counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to",Swann's Way
7178,"be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so,",Swann's Way
7178,"possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his",Swann's Way
7178,"arriving at Prévost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then,",Swann's Way
7178,"in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep",Swann's Way
7178,and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his,Swann's Way
7178,mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself,Swann's Way
7178,"and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the",Swann's Way
7178,thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard,Swann's Way
7178,"at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from",Swann's Way
7178,"which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as",Swann's Way
7178,though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because,Swann's Way
7178,"he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been",Swann's Way
7178,"hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was",Swann's Way
7178,"obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and",Swann's Way
7178,"drove to Prévost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone",Swann's Way
7178,"even--but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him,",Swann's Way
7178,"amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable",Swann's Way
7178,"to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such",Swann's Way
7178,"stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during",Swann's Way
7178,"this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality",Swann's Way
7178,"was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more",Swann's Way
7178,interesting.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at,Swann's Way
7178,"Prévost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so",Swann's Way
7178,"bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea,",Swann's Way
7178,not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take,Swann's Way
7178,"shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be",Swann's Way
7178,"much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every",Swann's Way
7178,"other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to",Swann's Way
7178,"cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to",Swann's Way
7178,withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of,Swann's Way
7178,"desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to",Swann's Way
7178,"be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for",Swann's Way
7178,"pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to",Swann's Way
7178,"assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her",Swann's Way
7178,"again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which",Swann's Way
7178,"would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day",Swann's Way
7178,"more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come",Swann's Way
7178,"to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet",Swann's Way
7178,never dared embrace.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every",Swann's Way
7178,"restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one",Swann's Way
7178,"direction, he sent in the other his coachman Rémi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan)",Swann's Way
7178,for whom he presently--after a fruitless search--found himself waiting,Swann's Way
7178,"at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and",Swann's Way
7178,Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching,Swann's Way
7178,"moment, as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady is there,""",Swann's Way
7178,"or as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady was not in",Swann's Way
7178,"any of the cafés."" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his",Swann's Way
7178,"evening--a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident",Swann's Way
7178,"which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or",Swann's Way
7178,"would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to",Swann's Way
7178,accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked,",Swann's Way
7178,"not ""Did you find the lady?"" but ""Remind me, to-morrow, to order in",Swann's Way
7178,"some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short."" Perhaps he had",Swann's Way
7178,"persuaded himself that, if Rémi had at last found Odette in some café,",Swann's Way
7178,"where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was",Swann's Way
7178,"already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a",Swann's Way
7178,"night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the",Swann's Way
7178,"attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place,",Swann's Way
7178,which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of,Swann's Way
7178,inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be,Swann's Way
7178,"seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid",Swann's Way
7178,"a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to",Swann's Way
7178,"perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the",Swann's Way
7178,"saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position,",Swann's Way
7178,"as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength",Swann's Way
7178,"and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with,",Swann's Way
7178,"""I have found the lady,"" he would have answered, ""Oh, yes, of course;",Swann's Way
7178,"that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,"" and would have",Swann's Way
7178,"continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his",Swann's Way
7178,"servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break",Swann's Way
7178,away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find",Swann's Way
7178,"her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when,Swann's Way
7178,"Rémi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a",Swann's Way
7178,cast-off cloak when he saw Rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and,Swann's Way
7178,retire from the quest.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Certainly not!"" he exclaimed. ""We must find the lady. It is most",Swann's Way
7178,important. She would be extremely put out--it's a business matter--and,Swann's Way
7178,"vexed with me if she didn't see me.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,"" answered Rémi, ""since",Swann's Way
7178,"it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was",Swann's Way
7178,"going to Prévost's, and then wasn't there.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go",Swann's Way
7178,out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people,Swann's Way
7178,"strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness.",Swann's Way
7178,"Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few",Swann's Way
7178,"words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering.",Swann's Way
7178,"Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though",Swann's Way
7178,"among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been",Swann's Way
7178,searching for a lost Eurydice.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the",Swann's Way
7178,"agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious",Swann's Way
7178,"as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the",Swann's Way
7178,human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking,Swann's Way
7178,"amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided,",Swann's Way
7178,that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not,Swann's Way
7178,"necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or",Swann's Way
7178,even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her,Swann's Way
7178,should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as--in,Swann's Way
7178,the moment when she has failed to meet us--for the pleasure which,Swann's Way
7178,we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly,Swann's Way
7178,"substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature",Swann's Way
7178,"herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised",Swann's Way
7178,society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage--the,Swann's Way
7178,"insensate, agonising desire to possess her.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Swann made Rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was,Swann's Way
7178,"the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated",Swann's Way
7178,"so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon",Swann's Way
7178,"their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman,",Swann's Way
7178,"as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce",Swann's Way
7178,"his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette--assuming",Swann's Way
7178,"that she had long since gone home to bed,--might yet be found seated in",Swann's Way
7178,some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the,Swann's Way
7178,"Maison Dorée, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching",Swann's Way
7178,"sight of her, was emerging from the Café Anglais, striding with haggard",Swann's Way
7178,"gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the",Swann's Way
7178,"opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had",Swann's Way
7178,"been no room at Prévost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the",Swann's Way
7178,"Maison Dorée, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have",Swann's Way
7178,"overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As,Swann's Way
7178,"for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed",Swann's Way
7178,"it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered",Swann's Way
7178,"even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his",Swann's Way
7178,"reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least,",Swann's Way
7178,"to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever",Swann's Way
7178,before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating,Swann's Way
7178,"probabilities,--it remained integral and external to himself; there",Swann's Way
7178,was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with,Swann's Way
7178,"truth--'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that",Swann's Way
7178,projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and,Swann's Way
7178,scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had,Swann's Way
7178,"lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded,",Swann's Way
7178,"albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has",Swann's Way
7178,"come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and",Swann's Way
7178,"is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let",Swann's Way
7178,"his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance",Swann's Way
7178,streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and",Swann's Way
7178,ordered his own to follow.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath",Swann's Way
7178,"the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers",Swann's Way
7178,"fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a",Swann's Way
7178,"flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a",Swann's Way
7178,"large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,'",Swann's Way
7178,"also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were",Swann's Way
7178,fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock,Swann's Way
7178,"which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the",Swann's Way
7178,horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she,Swann's Way
7178,"uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""It's all right,"" he assured her, ""don't be frightened."" And he slipped",Swann's Way
7178,"his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then",Swann's Way
7178,"went on: ""Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes",Swann's Way
7178,"or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the",Swann's Way
7178,flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid,Swann's Way
7178,of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more,Swann's Way
7178,"securely.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and",Swann's Way
7178,"smiled as she answered: ""No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the",Swann's Way
7178,"pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even",Swann's Way
7178,"because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed:",Swann's Way
7178,"""No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can",Swann's Way
7178,"easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you",Swann's Way
7178,"don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little--I think it must be",Swann's Way
7178,"pollen, spilt over your dress,--may I brush it off with my hand? That's",Swann's Way
7178,"not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a",Swann's Way
7178,little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong,Swann's Way

7178,"have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a",Swann's Way
7178,"little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if",Swann's Way
7178,I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I,Swann's Way
7178,"don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who",Swann's Way
7178,"should say, ""You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her,Swann's Way
7178,eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women,Swann's Way
7178,"of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type",Swann's Way
7178,"of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,"large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from",Swann's Way
7178,her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her,Swann's Way
7178,"neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as",Swann's Way
7178,"well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless,",Swann's Way
7178,"habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such",Swann's Way
7178,"moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all",Swann's Way
7178,"her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force",Swann's Way
7178,"were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she",Swann's Way
7178,"allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips,",Swann's Way
7178,"held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his",Swann's Way
7178,hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's,Swann's Way
7178,"movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to",Swann's Way
7178,"assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when",Swann's Way
7178,"a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps,",Swann's Way
7178,"moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not",Swann's Way
7178,"yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for",Swann's Way
7178,"the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his",Swann's Way
7178,"departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view",Swann's Way
7178,of a country to which he may never return.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which",Swann's Way
7178,had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete,Swann's Way
7178,"surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to",Swann's Way
7178,"appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked",Swann's Way
7178,the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which,Swann's Way
7178,"could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first",Swann's Way
7178,"occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If",Swann's Way
7178,"she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: ""It is most",Swann's Way
7178,unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've,Swann's Way
7178,"not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that",Swann's Way
7178,this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than,Swann's Way
7178,"the others?"" Or else, if she had none: ""Oh! no cattleyas this evening;",Swann's Way
7178,"then there's nothing for me to arrange."" So that for some time there",Swann's Way
7178,was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first,Swann's Way
7178,"evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers",Swann's Way
7178,"first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with",Swann's Way
7178,"this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or,",Swann's Way
7178,"rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had",Swann's Way
7178,"quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor ""Do a cattleya,"" transmuted",Swann's Way
7178,into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its,Swann's Way
7178,original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical,Swann's Way
7178,"possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing),",Swann's Way
7178,survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom,Swann's Way
7178,from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying,Swann's Way
7178,"""to make love"" had not the precise significance of its synonyms.",Swann's Way
7178,"However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard",Swann's Way
7178,the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable,Swann's Way
7178,"and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be",Swann's Way
7178,"described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,if the women concerned be--or be thought to be--so difficult as to,Swann's Way
7178,oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our,Swann's Way
7178,"relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the",Swann's Way
7178,"cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told",Swann's Way
7178,"himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his",Swann's Way
7178,intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge,Swann's Way
7178,for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure,Swann's Way
7178,"which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that",Swann's Way
7178,reason--as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid,Swann's Way
7178,the flowers of the earthly paradise--a pleasure which had never before,Swann's Way
7178,"existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure--and the",Swann's Way
7178,special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity--entirely,Swann's Way
7178,individual and new.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must",Swann's Way
7178,follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her,Swann's Way
7178,"dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before",Swann's Way
7178,"the eyes of his coachman, saying: ""What on earth does it matter what",Swann's Way
7178,"people see?"" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which",Swann's Way
7178,"happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"elsewhere), when--more and more rarely--he went into society, she would",Swann's Way
7178,"beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The",Swann's Way
7178,"season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from",Swann's Way
7178,"an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees,",Swann's Way
7178,"tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on",Swann's Way
7178,"his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going",Swann's Way
7178,in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot,Swann's Way
7178,"without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His",Swann's Way
7178,"friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was",Swann's Way
7178,no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now,Swann's Way
7178,demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention,Swann's Way
7178,"to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to",Swann's Way
7178,"be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately",Swann's Way
7178,"and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier,",Swann's Way
7178,"his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed",Swann's Way
7178,permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion,Swann's Way
7178,"manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not",Swann's Way
7178,only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates,Swann's Way
7178,the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the,Swann's Way
7178,"other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that",Swann's Way
7178,"wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on",Swann's Way
7178,afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him,Swann's Way
7178,"was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an",Swann's Way
7178,"irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank,",Swann's Way
7178,"as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have",Swann's Way
7178,"preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way,",Swann's Way
7178,and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his,Swann's Way
7178,putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to,Swann's Way
7178,"visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were",Swann's Way
7178,"saying to one another: ""He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly",Swann's Way
7178,"be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,""",Swann's Way
7178,made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose,Swann's Way
7178,"existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual",Swann's Way
7178,sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical,Swann's Way
7178,"interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not",Swann's Way
7178,"consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she",Swann's Way
7178,"was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that",Swann's Way
7178,"he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish,",Swann's Way
7178,"forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which",Swann's Way
7178,he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before,Swann's Way
7178,"his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable",Swann's Way
7178,that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to,Swann's Way
7178,that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so",Swann's Way
7178,"immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the",Swann's Way
7178,"power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person",Swann's Way
7178,"seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with",Swann's Way
7178,"poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on",Swann's Way
7178,which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann,Swann's Way
7178,could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him,Swann's Way
7178,"in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his",Swann's Way
7178,"victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the",Swann's Way
7178,"dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he",Swann's Way
7178,"would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the",Swann's Way
7178,"moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since",Swann's Way
7178,then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it,Swann's Way
7178,bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants,Swann's Way
7178,"to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden,",Swann's Way
7178,"he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the",Swann's Way
7178,"ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of",Swann's Way
7178,"the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room.",Swann's Way
7178,"He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer,",Swann's Way
7178,"before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the",Swann's Way
7178,"piano, some of her favourite music, the _Valse des Roses_, the _Pauvre",Swann's Way
7178,"Fou_ of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her",Swann's Way
7178,"will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead,",Swann's Way
7178,to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in",Swann's Way
7178,our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble,Swann's Way
7178,of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The,Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for",Swann's Way
7178,Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were,Swann's Way
7178,"no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by",Swann's Way
7178,"any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such",Swann's Way
7178,as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in,Swann's Way
7178,"her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood",Swann's Way
7178,"unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his",Swann's Way
7178,intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the,Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate",Swann's Way
7178,in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of,Swann's Way
7178,Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment,Swann's Way
7178,which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external,Swann's Way
7178,"object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely",Swann's Way
7178,"individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that",Swann's Way
7178,"of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little",Swann's Way
7178,"phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any",Swann's Way
7178,definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts,Swann's Way
7178,of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care,Swann's Way
7178,"for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men",Swann's Way
7178,"alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to",Swann's Way
7178,"inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might",Swann's Way
7178,"seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would",Swann's Way
7178,"come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence.",Swann's Way
7178,"Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have",Swann's Way
7178,said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe,Swann's Way
7178,"more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was",Swann's Way
7178,"shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin,",Swann's Way
7178,"at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from",Swann's Way
7178,"experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world",Swann's Way
7178,"for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because",Swann's Way
7178,"our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes",Swann's Way
7178,"our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep",Swann's Way
7178,"repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,--for him whose eyes, although",Swann's Way
7178,"delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute",Swann's Way
7178,"observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the",Swann's Way
7178,"barrenness of his life,--to feel himself transformed into a creature",Swann's Way
7178,"foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost",Swann's Way
7178,"a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world",Swann's Way
7178,"through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the",Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend,",Swann's Way
7178,with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his,Swann's Way
7178,"innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass,",Swann's Way
7178,"unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of",Swann's Way
7178,"sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how",Swann's Way
7178,much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase;,Swann's Way
7178,and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase,Swann's Way
7178,"repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong!",Swann's Way
7178,"He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it",Swann's Way
7178,"stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened",Swann's Way
7178,his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase,Swann's Way
7178,"again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she",Swann's Way
7178,"must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those",Swann's Way
7178,earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How,Swann's Way
7178,"closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until",Swann's Way
7178,"lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour,",Swann's Way
7178,as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to,Swann's Way
7178,"stop, saying: ""How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me?",Swann's Way
7178,I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to,Swann's Way
7178,"play the phrase or do you want to play with me?"" Then he would become",Swann's Way
7178,"annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which was transformed, as",Swann's Way
7178,"it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else",Swann's Way
7178,"she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy",Swann's Way
7178,"to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there,",Swann's Way
7178,giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had,Swann's Way
7178,"finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the",Swann's Way
7178,"wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room",Swann's Way
7178,"with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed",Swann's Way
7178,"and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would",Swann's Way
7178,"sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting",Swann's Way
7178,"from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would",Swann's Way
7178,fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks.,Swann's Way
7178,"And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to",Swann's Way
7178,"kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in",Swann's Way
7178,"memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove",Swann's Way
7178,"home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay",Swann's Way
7178,"her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring",Swann's Way
7178,"any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever",Swann's Way
7178,of jealousy--by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak,Swann's Way
7178,"of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening,",Swann's Way
7178,when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'--might help him to,Swann's Way
7178,"arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had",Swann's Way
7178,"been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of",Swann's Way
7178,"this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a",Swann's Way
7178,deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that,Swann's Way
7178,"the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own,",Swann's Way
7178,"and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was",Swann's Way
7178,"obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether",Swann's Way
7178,"this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether",Swann's Way
7178,"presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance,",Swann's Way
7178,"save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of",Swann's Way
7178,ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding,Swann's Way
7178,"in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had",Swann's Way
7178,"found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with",Swann's Way
7178,"this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette",Swann's Way
7178,alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his,Swann's Way
7178,"boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later",Swann's Way
7178,"life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular",Swann's Way
7178,being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure,Swann's Way
7178,"in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became",Swann's Way
7178,"gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent",Swann's Way
7178,"her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little,",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing",Swann's Way
7178,"us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire for knowledge.",Swann's Way
7178,"And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life",Swann's Way
7178,"had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years",Swann's Way
7178,"earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a",Swann's Way
7178,"woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still",Swann's Way
7178,attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of,Swann's Way
7178,"characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for",Swann's Way
7178,"many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would",Swann's Way
7178,"say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact",Swann's Way
7178,counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a,Swann's Way
7178,"person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly",Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so",Swann's Way
7178,"that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying",Swann's Way
7178,"that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face",Swann's Way
7178,"with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing,",Swann's Way
7178,"stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how",Swann's Way
7178,"painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her",Swann's Way
7178,"answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness,",Swann's Way
7178,"seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents,",Swann's Way
7178,for the obvious falsehood of her words.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon",Swann's Way
7178,"him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Vermeer",Swann's Way
7178,to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that,Swann's Way
7178,Mme. de Crécy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of,Swann's Way
7178,"her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as",Swann's Way
7178,"soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear--changing the curve",Swann's Way
7178,"of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks--an",Swann's Way
7178,all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that,Swann's Way
7178,"smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had",Swann's Way
7178,"greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his",Swann's Way
7178,"rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times,",Swann's Way
7178,"since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and",Swann's Way
7178,"colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon",Swann's Way
7178,"which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions,",Swann's Way
7178,"traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But,",Swann's Way
7178,"once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was",Swann's Way
7178,"not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it,",Swann's Way
7178,"some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love,",Swann's Way
7178,had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least,Swann's Way
7178,"importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that",Swann's Way
7178,"very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed",Swann's Way
7178,"with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her",Swann's Way
7178,bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling,Swann's Way
7178,him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not,Swann's Way
7178,wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been,Swann's Way
7178,seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he,Swann's Way
7178,registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going,Swann's Way
7178,"at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life--a",Swann's Way
7178,"life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him--of his",Swann's Way
7178,"mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those",Swann's Way
7178,"smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a",Swann's Way
7178,"Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the,Swann's Way
7178,"_Valse des Roses_, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things",Swann's Way
7178,"that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to",Swann's Way
7178,correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was,Swann's Way
7178,not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her,Swann's Way
7178,"about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get",Swann's Way
7178,"to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the",Swann's Way
7178,"Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she",Swann's Way
7178,"asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman",Swann's Way
7178,"that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she",Swann's Way
7178,"had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: ""I'm sure,",Swann's Way
7178,"poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true,",Swann's Way
7178,if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not,Swann's Way
7178,you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I,Swann's Way
7178,"know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with",Swann's Way
7178,"a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and",Swann's Way
7178,"heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than",Swann's Way
7178,"three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished."" If,",Swann's Way
7178,"then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one",Swann's Way
7178,"ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would",Swann's Way
7178,"cease to listen, saying: ""Yes... I never thought it would be like that.""",Swann's Way
7178,And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to,Swann's Way
7178,"lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he",Swann's Way
7178,"had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all",Swann's Way
7178,"properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt",Swann's Way
7178,"with a brisk, ""More in it? What?... Do tell me!"", but he did not tell",Swann's Way
7178,"her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different",Swann's Way
7178,"from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was",Swann's Way
7178,"afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the",Swann's Way
7178,same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what",Swann's Way
7178,"she had supposed. ""You're always so reserved; I can't make you out."" She",Swann's Way
7178,"marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy",Swann's Way
7178,"to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens,",Swann's Way
7178,"often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or",Swann's Way
7178,"artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom",Swann's Way
7178,"he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been",Swann's Way
7178,convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any,Swann's Way
7178,admiration for his ideas--for those are entirely beyond them--but by,Swann's Way
7178,their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the,Swann's Way
7178,respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social,Swann's Way
7178,"position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure",Swann's Way
7178,invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be,Swann's Way
7178,"bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of",Swann's Way
7178,"her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind.",Swann's Way
7178,The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never,Swann's Way
7178,"to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was,",Swann's Way
7178,"she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another",Swann's Way
7178,"girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. ""But,""",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann objected, ""surely, people don't all know your friend."" ""Yes,",Swann's Way
7178,"don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid."" Swann was",Swann's Way
7178,"unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew",Swann's Way
7178,"that such generalisations as ""People are so horrid,"" and ""A word of",Swann's Way
7178,"scandal spreads like a spot of oil,"" were generally accepted as true;",Swann's Way
7178,"there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable.",Swann's Way
7178,Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the,Swann's Way
7178,"question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental",Swann's Way
7178,"oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced",Swann's Way
7178,"by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which",Swann's Way
7178,"concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very",Swann's Way
7178,"great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world",Swann's Way
7178,which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception,Swann's Way
7178,"of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a",Swann's Way
7178,"genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a",Swann's Way
7178,"little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark",Swann's Way
7178,"and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted",Swann's Way
7178,"to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held",Swann's Way
7178,"by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates",Swann's Way
7178,"from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a",Swann's Way
7178,considerable distance--with more or less strength according as one,Swann's Way
7178,is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre--over the widening,Swann's Way
7178,"circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names",Swann's Way
7178,form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by,Swann's Way
7178,"heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they",Swann's Way
7178,"have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation",Swann's Way
7178,"that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of",Swann's Way
7178,"the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had",Swann's Way
7178,"been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner",Swann's Way
7178,"had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can",Swann's Way
7178,estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one,Swann's Way
7178,"of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable",Swann's Way
7178,"world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do",Swann's Way
7178,"not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite",Swann's Way
7178,"another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to",Swann's Way
7178,"which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic--common",Swann's Way
7178,alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before,Swann's Way
7178,which Mme. Cottard bowed--of being directly accessible to all. The other,Swann's Way
7178,"kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted,",Swann's Way
7178,accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of,Swann's Way
7178,"some one: ""He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer,",Swann's Way
7178,"with a touch of contempt, ""Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy,",Swann's Way
7178,"at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What",Swann's Way
7178,"do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de",Swann's Way
7178,"l'Impératrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays",Swann's Way
7178,"the Eden-Théâtre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the",Swann's Way
7178,"balls...""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What balls?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean.",Swann's Way
7178,"Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of",Swann's Way
7178,"the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the",Swann's Way
7178,"best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears",Swann's Way
7178,such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a,Swann's Way
7178,light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with,Swann's Way
7178,"that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave",Swann's Way
7178,"a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there.",Swann's Way
7178,I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the,Swann's Way
7178,"door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad,",Swann's Way
7178,"now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball.",Swann's Way
7178,"You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the",Swann's Way
7178,people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am,Swann's Way
7178,"surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion;",Swann's Way
7178,"feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous,",Swann's Way
7178,"devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting",Swann's Way
7178,"it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased",Swann's Way
7178,"to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except",Swann's Way
7178,when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at,Swann's Way
7178,race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would,Swann's Way
7178,"continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to",Swann's Way
7178,regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise,Swann's Way
7178,"de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet",Swann's Way
7178,with strings.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a",Swann's Way

7178,"that!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the,Swann's Way
7178,"Quai d'Orléans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered",Swann's Way
7178,unworthy of him.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to",Swann's Way
7178,assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved,Swann's Way
7178,"to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for",Swann's Way
7178,"'bric-à-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point",Swann's Way
7178,"of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old",Swann's Way
7178,"family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give",Swann's Way
7178,"any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once",Swann's Way
7178,"about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that",Swann's Way
7178,everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell,Swann's Way
7178,him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she,Swann's Way
7178,replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were,Swann's Way
7178,"panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and",Swann's Way
7178,"added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a",Swann's Way
7178,"person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom",Swann's Way
7178,"one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as",Swann's Way
7178,some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener,Swann's Way
7178,"will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: ""Her",Swann's Way
7178,"dining-room... is... eighteenth century!"" Incidentally, she had thought",Swann's Way
7178,"it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women",Swann's Way
7178,"looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She",Swann's Way
7178,"mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the",Swann's Way
7178,"name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom",Swann's Way
7178,"she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he",Swann's Way
7178,"could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one",Swann's Way
7178,"of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little",Swann's Way
7178,"house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards,",Swann's Way
7178,Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Château at Blois. It was,Swann's Way
7178,on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of,Swann's Way
7178,his abode on the Quai d'Orléans; he having ventured the criticism that,Swann's Way
7178,"her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on,",Swann's Way
7178,"although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming,",Swann's Way
7178,but in the 'Sham-Antique.',Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs",Swann's Way
7178,"and threadbare carpets!"" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of",Swann's Way
7178,the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the,Swann's Way
7178,acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.',Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised",Swann's Way
7178,"sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour",Swann's Way
7178,"and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of",Swann's Way
7178,"humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided",Swann's Way
7178,one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he,Swann's Way
7178,loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the,Swann's Way
7178,"old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in",Swann's Way
7178,"this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that",Swann's Way
7178,"interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether,",Swann's Way
7178,"she would come home saying: ""Why, he's an adorable creature; so",Swann's Way
7178,"sensitive! I had no idea,"" and she would conceive for him a strong and",Swann's Way
7178,"sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had",Swann's Way
7178,"these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged,",Swann's Way
7178,"of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she",Swann's Way
7178,"would add, pouting: ""It's not the same thing, you see, with him,""",Swann's Way
7178,"and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the",Swann's Way
7178,"practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of",Swann's Way
7178,"which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy",Swann's Way
7178,"in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad",Swann's Way
7178,"taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same",Swann's Way
7178,"he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her,",Swann's Way
7178,"which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those",Swann's Way
7178,"characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities",Swann's Way
7178,"of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a",Swann's Way
7178,"happy mood because she was going to see the _Reine Topaze_, or when her",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the",Swann's Way
7178,"flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and",Swann's Way
7178,"toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular",Swann's Way
7178,"attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's",Swann's Way
7178,"certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at",Swann's Way
7178,"times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a",Swann's Way
7178,"portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so",Swann's Way
7178,distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her,Swann's Way
7178,face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it,Swann's Way
7178,"with his lips. ""Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the",Swann's Way
7178,"flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we",Swann's Way
7178,"will take her there, we can but obey her wishes."" As Swann's sight was",Swann's Way
7178,"beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles,",Swann's Way
7178,"which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted",Swann's Way
7178,"a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she",Swann's Way
7178,"saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: ""I really do",Swann's Way
7178,"think--for a man, that is to say--it is tremendously smart! How nice you",Swann's Way
7178,"look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!"" she",Swann's Way
7178,"concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say",Swann's Way
7178,"these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he",Swann's Way
7178,would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she,Swann's Way
7178,"believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose",Swann's Way
7178,"taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a",Swann's Way
7178,grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would,Swann's Way
7178,accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of,Swann's Way
7178,works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose,Swann's Way
7178,"company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a",Swann's Way
7178,little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some,Swann's Way
7178,"decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition",Swann's Way
7178,"of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an",Swann's Way
7178,"educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but",Swann's Way
7178,"would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now",Swann's Way
7178,"that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her",Swann's Way
7178,"sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so",Swann's Way
7178,attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she,Swann's Way
7178,"liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in",Swann's Way
7178,"adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits",Swann's Way
7178,"and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested",Swann's Way
7178,"to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred",Swann's Way
7178,"them to his own. If he went again to _Serge Panine_, if he looked out",Swann's Way
7178,"for opportunities of going to watch Olivier Métra conducting, it was for",Swann's Way
7178,the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's,Swann's Way
7178,"mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This",Swann's Way
7178,"charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and",Swann's Way
7178,"pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than",Swann's Way
7178,"the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed",Swann's Way
7178,"to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having",Swann's Way
7178,"allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his",Swann's Way
7178,"scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated",Swann's Way
7178,"them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had",Swann's Way
7178,fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have,Swann's Way
7178,"no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of",Swann's Way
7178,"dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar",Swann's Way
7178,of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most,Swann's Way
7178,refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached,Swann's Way
7178,to receiving cards for a private view was not in itself any more,Swann's Way
7178,ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in,Swann's Way
7178,"going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the",Swann's Way
7178,admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any,Swann's Way
7178,more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined,Swann's Way
7178,as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied,Swann's Way
7178,"himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with",Swann's Way
7178,"the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like",Swann's Way
7178,nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was",Swann's Way
7178,"no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her",Swann's Way
7178,"more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since,",Swann's Way
7178,"at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings,",Swann's Way
7178,"games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre",Swann's Way
7178,"parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained",Swann's Way
7178,"'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by",Swann's Way
7178,"inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the",Swann's Way
7178,"little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine",Swann's Way
7178,"merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him",Swann's Way
7178,to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to,Swann's Way
7178,"whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion,",Swann's Way
7178,"that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to",Swann's Way
7178,suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition,Swann's Way
7178,"which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his",Swann's Way
7178,"intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as",Swann's Way
7178,"his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was",Swann's Way
7178,"in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her",Swann's Way
7178,"was all that he could ask. ""What a charming atmosphere!"" he said to",Swann's Way
7178,"himself. ""How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far",Swann's Way
7178,"more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows.",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather",Swann's Way
7178,"absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for",Swann's Way
7178,"works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about",Swann's Way
7178,"some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas",Swann's Way
7178,about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great,Swann's Way
7178,"intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking",Swann's Way
7178,"to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for",Swann's Way
7178,"the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be",Swann's Way
7178,"paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come",Swann's Way
7178,"across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one",Swann's Way
7178,does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour,Swann's Way
7178,"there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare",Swann's Way

7178,"often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never",Swann's Way

7178,not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or,Swann's Way
7178,"other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had",Swann's Way
7178,"taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were",Swann's Way
7178,making of his brilliant position in society--doubtless all these things,Swann's Way
7178,"contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the",Swann's Way
7178,fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they,Swann's Way
7178,"had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable",Swann's Way
7178,chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the,Swann's Way
7178,"Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were",Swann's Way
7178,not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his,Swann's Way
7178,"friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they",Swann's Way
7178,"had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of",Swann's Way
7178,"entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never",Swann's Way
7178,come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the,Swann's Way
7178,"houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he",Swann's Way
7178,infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had,Swann's Way
7178,he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores',Swann's Way
7178,"in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as",Swann's Way
7178,"they well knew, they were powerless to extort.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them,Swann's Way

7178,whom they were building great hopes--the Comte de Forcheville! (It,Swann's Way
7178,turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of,Swann's Way
7178,"Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement:",Swann's Way
7178,the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always,Swann's Way
7178,"supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and",Swann's Way
7178,had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively,Swann's Way
7178,"aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,'",Swann's Way
7178,"which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never",Swann's Way
7178,"dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any",Swann's Way
7178,other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from,Swann's Way
7178,associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth,Swann's Way
7178,his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for,Swann's Way
7178,"the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged,",Swann's Way
7178,"the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,--whereas",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these",Swann's Way
7178,"without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them,",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which",Swann's Way
7178,"permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the",Swann's Way
7178,"least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted",Swann's Way
7178,by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which,Swann's Way
7178,Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences,Swann's Way
7178,"between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated",Swann's Way
7178,the disgrace of Swann.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from",Swann's Way
7178,"the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a",Swann's Way
7178,"watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his",Swann's Way
7178,other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time,Swann's Way
7178,"to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that",Swann's Way

7178,"Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed",Swann's Way
7178,"superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his",Swann's Way
7178,"illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he",Swann's Way
7178,"spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those",Swann's Way
7178,"sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and",Swann's Way
7178,imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan',Swann's Way
7178,"what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps,",Swann's Way
7178,"because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously",Swann's Way
7178,"preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that",Swann's Way
7178,he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those,Swann's Way
7178,"subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only",Swann's Way
7178,because the folds of the gown still clung.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the",Swann's Way
7178,"right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great",Swann's Way

7178,"a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the",Swann's Way
7178,"whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to",Swann's Way
7178,"smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn",Swann's Way
7178,"at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of",Swann's Way
7178,"the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity",Swann's Way
7178,of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"""You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the",Swann's Way

7178,"appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes",Swann's Way
7178,"tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between",Swann's Way
7178,"which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream.",Swann's Way

7178,easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed,Swann's Way

7178,"him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained",Swann's Way
7178,"to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social",Swann's Way
7178,"existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of",Swann's Way
7178,"intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything",Swann's Way
7178,"in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar,",Swann's Way
7178,"and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to",Swann's Way
7178,"good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this",Swann's Way

7178,"Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville",Swann's Way
7178,"fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"Plantagenet for years before they were married,"" tried to prompt Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting ""Isn't that so, M.",Swann's Way

7178,the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into,Swann's Way

7178,"Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the",Swann's Way

7178,had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called,Swann's Way
7178,"the ""little speech"" of the painter. ""Your friend has such a flow of",Swann's Way

7178,"pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to",Swann's Way

7178,"good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"upon some undeserved good fortune: ""Isn't that so, Swann? I never see",Swann's Way
7178,"anything of you, do I?--But then, where on earth is one to see him? The",Swann's Way
7178,"creature spends all his time shut up with the La Trémoïlles, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"Laumes and all that lot!"" The imputation would have been false at any",Swann's Way
7178,"time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had",Swann's Way
7178,given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere,Swann's Way
7178,names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them,Swann's Way
7178,"in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression",Swann's Way
7178,"which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this",Swann's Way
7178,"tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to",Swann's Way
7178,"make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious",Swann's Way
7178,"solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice,",Swann's Way
7178,"to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been",Swann's Way
7178,"addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf",Swann's Way

7178,attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should,Swann's Way
7178,"appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without",Swann's Way
7178,"protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very",Swann's Way
7178,"mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that",Swann's Way
7178,"her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the",Swann's Way
7178,"unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly",Swann's Way
7178,"emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of",Swann's Way
7178,"those La Trémoïlles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed",Swann's Way
7178,"to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to",Swann's Way
7178,"view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would",Swann's Way
7178,have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was,Swann's Way
7178,"all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's",Swann's Way
7178,"design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry,",Swann's Way
7178,where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel,Swann's Way
7178,"to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Trémoïlles or Laumes, whose",Swann's Way
7178,"equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and",Swann's Way
7178,"betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to",Swann's Way
7178,invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity,Swann's Way
7178,of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be,Swann's Way
7178,understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that,Swann's Way
7178,"house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated",Swann's Way

7178,on Swann.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to,Swann's Way

7178,"merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could",Swann's Way
7178,"not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin,",Swann's Way
7178,"who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife,",Swann's Way

7178,"something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental",Swann's Way
7178,"habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated",Swann's Way

7178,"explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. ""I should",Swann's Way
7178,"say that, as a specimen of the female form--""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!"" the words came",Swann's Way
7178,"tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary",Swann's Way
7178,"old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the",Swann's Way
7178,conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with,Swann's Way
7178,that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed,Swann's Way
7178,"attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion,",Swann's Way
7178,inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the,Swann's Way
7178,"joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing",Swann's Way
7178,"of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by",Swann's Way
7178,"a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious.",Swann's Way
7178,Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man,Swann's Way

7178,"though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke",Swann's Way
7178,from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could,Swann's Way
7178,prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he,Swann's Way
7178,"and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter",Swann's Way
7178,"was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging",Swann's Way
7178,"her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each",Swann's Way
7178,"representing Comedy, but in a different way.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of,Swann's Way
7178,"his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment,",Swann's Way
7178,murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated,Swann's Way
7178,"now whenever he had to go to the place in question: ""I must just go and",Swann's Way
7178,"see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,"" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough",Swann's Way
7178,began all over again.,Swann's Way

7178,"""Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!""",Swann's Way

7178,"you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very",Swann's Way
7178,"often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner",Swann's Way

7178,"Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had",Swann's Way
7178,"never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: ""No,",Swann's Way
7178,"no. The word isn't _serpent-à-sonates_, it's _serpent-à-sonnettes_!"" he",Swann's Way

7178,"made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite",Swann's Way
7178,"grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural",Swann's Way

7178,"come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase,",Swann's Way
7178,when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt,Swann's Way
7178,"upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit",Swann's Way

7178,"or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might",Swann's Way
7178,"make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, ""It's",Swann's Way

7178,"foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities",Swann's Way
7178,"which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an",Swann's Way
7178,interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered,",Swann's Way
7178,"as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers,",Swann's Way
7178,interwoven with precious jewels--with that Odette upon whose face he,Swann's Way
7178,"had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer,",Swann's Way
7178,"resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness,",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on",Swann's Way
7178,"the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently",Swann's Way
7178,"turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his",Swann's Way
7178,"collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his",Swann's Way
7178,title-deeds and bonds;--the thought of the banker reminded him that he,Swann's Way
7178,"must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the",Swann's Way
7178,"current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in",Swann's Way
7178,"her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given",Swann's Way
7178,"her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond",Swann's Way
7178,"necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for",Swann's Way
7178,"his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy,",Swann's Way
7178,and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love,Swann's Way
7178,for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself,Swann's Way
7178,"diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not",Swann's Way
7178,"precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that",Swann's Way
7178,idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious,Swann's Way
7178,"nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life,",Swann's Way
7178,"such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn",Swann's Way
7178,"in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying",Swann's Way
7178,"the household accounts and the rent, had locked up in a drawer in",Swann's Way
7178,"the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four",Swann's Way
7178,"others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she,Swann's Way
7178,"could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title,",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He",Swann's Way
7178,"could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental",Swann's Way
7178,"lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential,",Swann's Way
7178,"happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his",Swann's Way
7178,"brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting",Swann's Way
7178,"had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering",Swann's Way
7178,"a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind",Swann's Way

7178,"wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light",Swann's Way

7178,"six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise",Swann's Way
7178,for her and to give her pleasure.,Swann's Way

7178,"the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his",Swann's Way
7178,"contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the",Swann's Way
7178,"result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest",Swann's Way
7178,lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely,Swann's Way
7178,"mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he",Swann's Way
7178,could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He,Swann's Way
7178,had the same regard--to a degree of identity which they would never have,Swann's Way
7178,suspected--for the little families with small incomes who asked him to,Swann's Way
7178,"dances in their flats (""straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the",Swann's Way
7178,"door on the left"") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most",Swann's Way
7178,splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually,Swann's Way
7178,'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families,Swann's Way
7178,"in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of",Swann's Way
7178,"wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into",Swann's Way
7178,"cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their",Swann's Way
7178,"counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays,",Swann's Way
7178,people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive,Swann's Way
7178,from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were,Swann's Way
7178,"dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he",Swann's Way
7178,"changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette",Swann's Way
7178,gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar,Swann's Way
7178,charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his,Swann's Way
7178,"carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in",Swann's Way
7178,"after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which",Swann's Way
7178,"he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table,",Swann's Way
7178,"unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm",Swann's Way
7178,"himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would",Swann's Way
7178,give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat,Swann's Way
7178,"and nostrils--a new experience, this,--as he fastened the bunch of",Swann's Way
7178,columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither,Swann's Way
7178,"well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the",Swann's Way
7178,"Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in",Swann's Way
7178,"the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even",Swann's Way
7178,"for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the",Swann's Way
7178,finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a,Swann's Way
7178,"city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what",Swann's Way
7178,"was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray,",Swann's Way
7178,"where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed,",Swann's Way
7178,"thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from Méséglise,",Swann's Way
7178,he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an,Swann's Way
7178,"arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed",Swann's Way
7178,"with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner,",Swann's Way
7178,"trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about",Swann's Way
7178,his table currant-bush and rose.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so",Swann's Way
7178,"abruptly--especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the",Swann's Way
7178,'faithful' before their normal time--that on one occasion the Princesse,Swann's Way
7178,des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left,Swann's Way
7178,"before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the",Swann's Way
7178,Bois) observed:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might",Swann's Way
7178,be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us,Swann's Way
7178,"all as a joke.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go",Swann's Way
7178,"down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the Ile des Cygnes",Swann's Way
7178,"or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would",Swann's Way
7178,return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young,Swann's Way
7178,"leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the",Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant",Swann's Way
7178,"piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken",Swann's Way
7178,immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room,Swann's Way
7178,or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to,Swann's Way
7178,favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of,Swann's Way
7178,"entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would",Swann's Way
7178,"stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary",Swann's Way
7178,sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself,Swann's Way
7178,"that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force",Swann's Way
7178,himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement,Swann's Way
7178,"into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a",Swann's Way
7178,"feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him,",Swann's Way
7178,robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable,Swann's Way
7178,background to the impressions that we derive from nature.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and",Swann's Way
7178,"had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual",Swann's Way
7178,"banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed",Swann's Way
7178,"across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was",Swann's Way
7178,"now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then,",Swann's Way
7178,"till I get home; don't be too late.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously,",Swann's Way
7178,at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the,Swann's Way
7178,"'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow,",Swann's Way
7178,"before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each",Swann's Way
7178,"other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and",Swann's Way
7178,her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had,Swann's Way
7178,often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in,Swann's Way
7178,the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to,Swann's Way
7178,himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard,Swann's Way
7178,"it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that,",Swann's Way
7178,"to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and",Swann's Way
7178,"desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused",Swann's Way
7178,a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest,Swann's Way
7178,particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value,Swann's Way
7178,"to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her",Swann's Way
7178,"upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that,",Swann's Way
7178,"and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly",Swann's Way
7178,"possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her",Swann's Way
7178,"aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to",Swann's Way
7178,her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of,Swann's Way
7178,"the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should",Swann's Way
7178,"last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring",Swann's Way
7178,"rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take",Swann's Way
7178,"him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having",Swann's Way
7178,"invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting",Swann's Way
7178,"no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather",Swann's Way
7178,"than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps,",Swann's Way
7178,if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every,Swann's Way
7178,"evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and",Swann's Way
7178,fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly,Swann's Way
7178,desired it.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology",Swann's Way
7178,"for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and",Swann's Way
7178,"she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour,",Swann's Way
7178,that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt,Swann's Way
7178,tired and wished to sleep.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No cattleya, then, to-night?"" he asked, ""and I've been looking forward",Swann's Way
7178,"so to a nice little cattleya.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: ""No, dear, no cattleya",Swann's Way
7178,"tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains,Swann's Way
7178,"close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house",Swann's Way
7178,"again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting",Swann's Way
7178,"some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired,",Swann's Way
7178,that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should,Swann's Way
7178,"suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left",Swann's Way
7178,"the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the",Swann's Way
7178,stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch.,Swann's Way
7178,"It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took",Swann's Way
7178,"a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at",Swann's Way
7178,"right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house,",Swann's Way
7178,"and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom",Swann's Way
7178,"window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all",Swann's Way
7178,deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite,Swann's Way
7178,"her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the",Swann's Way
7178,"lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one,",Swann's Way
7178,"from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a",Swann's Way
7178,"wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the",Swann's Way
7178,"room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it,",Swann's Way
7178,"far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its",Swann's Way
7178,"message: ""She is there--expecting you,"" and now tortured him with: ""She",Swann's Way
7178,"is there with the man she was expecting."" He must know who; he tiptoed",Swann's Way
7178,"along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting",Swann's Way
7178,"bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered",Swann's Way
7178,"as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind",Swann's Way
7178,"the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that",Swann's Way
7178,murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his,Swann's Way
7178,"own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at",Swann's Way
7178,that moment tasting with the stranger.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced,Swann's Way
7178,him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its,Swann's Way
7178,"uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that",Swann's Way
7178,"first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost",Swann's Way
7178,"within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light,",Swann's Way
7178,"caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which,",Swann's Way
7178,"when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or",Swann's Way
7178,"rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had",Swann's Way
7178,"come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn",Swann's Way
7178,"that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while",Swann's Way
7178,"he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him,",Swann's Way
7178,as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been,Swann's Way
7178,"tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in",Swann's Way
7178,"their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they",Swann's Way
7178,"believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a",Swann's Way
7178,"plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to",Swann's Way
7178,"tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable",Swann's Way
7178,feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution,Swann's Way
7178,"of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure.",Swann's Way
7178,"If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the",Swann's Way
7178,delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago--though only when,Swann's Way
7178,"a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette--now it was",Swann's Way
7178,"another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth,",Swann's Way
7178,"that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for",Swann's Way
7178,"a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress,",Swann's Way
7178,"receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the",Swann's Way
7178,"sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost",Swann's Way
7178,"impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette--Odette in her activities,",Swann's Way
7178,"her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in",Swann's Way
7178,"his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had",Swann's Way
7178,always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things,Swann's Way
7178,"were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he",Swann's Way
7178,"listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his",Swann's Way
7178,mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and,Swann's Way
7178,uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another,Swann's Way
7178,"person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which",Swann's Way
7178,"he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a",Swann's Way
7178,"woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which",Swann's Way
7178,"he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which,",Swann's Way
7178,"until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night,",Swann's Way
7178,"outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly",Swann's Way
7178,"provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening",Swann's Way
7178,"at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the",Swann's Way
7178,"deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation",Swann's Way
7178,"of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of",Swann's Way
7178,"scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value",Swann's Way
7178,and being legitimately employable in the search for truth.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at,Swann's Way
7178,"the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that",Swann's Way
7178,"he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She",Swann's Way
7178,"had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who",Swann's Way
7178,"spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would",Swann's Way
7178,"detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as",Swann's Way
7178,"he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she",Swann's Way
7178,loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness,Swann's Way
7178,thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate,Swann's Way
7178,"gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed",Swann's Way
7178,to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story,Swann's Way
7178,"of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to",Swann's Way
7178,"reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window,",Swann's Way
7178,"streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of",Swann's Way
7178,"one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures",Swann's Way
7178,the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for,Swann's Way
7178,the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that,Swann's Way
7178,"brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm,",Swann's Way
7178,"so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt--which he so",Swann's Way
7178,"desperately wanted to feel--that he had over them, lay perhaps not so",Swann's Way
7178,much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew,Swann's Way
7178,himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again;,Swann's Way
7178,louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice--he strained his ears,Swann's Way
7178,"to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the",Swann's Way
7178,voice could be--asked:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Who's that?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window,Swann's Way
7178,"first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to",Swann's Way
7178,"retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible,",Swann's Way
7178,"too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty,",Swann's Way
7178,welcoming tone:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light.",Swann's Way
7178,"I wanted to know if you were feeling better.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one",Swann's Way
7178,of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into,Swann's Way
7178,"the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the",Swann's Way
7178,"habit, when he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by",Swann's Way
7178,the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows,Swann's Way
7178,"otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and",Swann's Way
7178,"had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made",Swann's Way
7178,"what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction",Swann's Way
7178,"of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having",Swann's Way
7178,"feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference,",Swann's Way
7178,"he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof",Swann's Way
7178,"of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and",Swann's Way
7178,finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other,Swann's Way
7178,"enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to",Swann's Way
7178,think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering,Swann's Way
7178,"course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would",Swann's Way
7178,"startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness,",Swann's Way
7178,"and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had",Swann's Way
7178,"been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the",Swann's Way
7178,"case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the",Swann's Way
7178,"mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has",Swann's Way
7178,"momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by",Swann's Way
7178,"recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but",Swann's Way
7178,"to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation",Swann's Way
7178,"with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually",Swann's Way
7178,uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a,Swann's Way
7178,"clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle",Swann's Way
7178,"mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was",Swann's Way
7178,all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which,Swann's Way
7178,"she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first",Swann's Way
7178,evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay,Swann's Way
7178,"nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her",Swann's Way
7178,"shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love,",Swann's Way
7178,"presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile",Swann's Way
7178,"with which she had greeted him that very evening,--with which, now,",Swann's Way
7178,"perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to",Swann's Way
7178,"another--of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other",Swann's Way
7178,"lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection",Swann's Way
7178,that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he,Swann's Way
7178,"bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches,",Swann's Way
7178,"rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to",Swann's Way
7178,"one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes,",Swann's Way
7178,"aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for",Swann's Way
7178,others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he,Swann's Way
7178,"tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been",Swann's Way
7178,"so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh",Swann's Way
7178,"charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they",Swann's Way
7178,would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret,Swann's Way
7178,torture-chamber.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden,Swann's Way
7178,"expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the",Swann's Way
7178,"first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'.",Swann's Way
7178,"Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his",Swann's Way
7178,"brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt",Swann's Way
7178,"of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed",Swann's Way
7178,"by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had",Swann's Way
7178,passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever,Swann's Way
7178,"tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for",Swann's Way
7178,some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from,Swann's Way
7178,"the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and",Swann's Way
7178,whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling,Swann's Way
7178,"embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville",Swann's Way
7178,"replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse,",Swann's Way
7178,"going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted,",Swann's Way
7178,"by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor",Swann's Way
7178,"creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and",Swann's Way
7178,"receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with",Swann's Way
7178,"tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but",Swann's Way
7178,"when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal",Swann's Way
7178,"expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to",Swann's Way
7178,bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes,Swann's Way
7178,"had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity,",Swann's Way
7178,of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she,Swann's Way
7178,"had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly",Swann's Way
7178,"implied: ""That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you",Swann's Way
7178,"see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,"" that Forcheville,",Swann's Way
7178,"when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended",Swann's Way
7178,"anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: ""He need",Swann's Way
7178,only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good,Swann's Way
7178,"scolding does a man no harm, at any time.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call,",Swann's Way
7178,"and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it",Swann's Way
7178,"occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he",Swann's Way
7178,"never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at",Swann's Way
7178,"home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he",Swann's Way
7178,"believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a",Swann's Way
7178,"sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and",Swann's Way
7178,"annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her",Swann's Way
7178,"house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and",Swann's Way
7178,"he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still",Swann's Way
7178,no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He,Swann's Way
7178,"turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in",Swann's Way
7178,believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with,Swann's Way
7178,the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting,Swann's Way
7178,"for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she",Swann's Way
7178,"had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had",Swann's Way
7178,"awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out",Swann's Way
7178,"to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him",Swann's Way
7178,knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of,Swann's Way
7178,"those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise,",Swann's Way
7178,console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood,Swann's Way
7178,"which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated,",Swann's Way
7178,and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true,Swann's Way
7178,"that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to",Swann's Way
7178,"disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her",Swann's Way
7178,heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to,Swann's Way
7178,"whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted",Swann's Way
7178,"like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties",Swann's Way
7178,"were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void;",Swann's Way
7178,"still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely",Swann's Way
7178,"the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was",Swann's Way
7178,"the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment,",Swann's Way
7178,"of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was",Swann's Way
7178,"the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less",Swann's Way
7178,"dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. ""At any rate, this is true,""",Swann's Way
7178,"she said to herself; ""that's always something to the good; he may make",Swann's Way
7178,"inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that",Swann's Way
7178,"will give me away."" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she",Swann's Way
7178,had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth,Swann's Way
7178,"had sharp edges which could not be made to fit in, except to those",Swann's Way
7178,contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily,Swann's Way
7178,"detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she",Swann's Way
7178,"might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and",Swann's Way
7178,"by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was",Swann's Way
7178,elsewhere.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, that she wanted to see me,"" Swann thought to himself. ""But that",Swann's Way
7178,"doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he",Swann's Way
7178,"thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some",Swann's Way
7178,falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she,Swann's Way
7178,"spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and",Swann's Way
7178,"sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly",Swann's Way
7178,"feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that,",Swann's Way
7178,"like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a",Swann's Way
7178,"faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable",Swann's Way
7178,"truth;--what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when",Swann's Way
7178,"he had called,--a truth of which he would never possess any more than",Swann's Way
7178,"these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would",Swann's Way
7178,"exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who",Swann's Way
7178,"would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never",Swann's Way
7178,"yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong",Swann's Way
7178,suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not in themselves,Swann's Way
7178,"passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with",Swann's Way
7178,"other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every",Swann's Way
7178,"rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with",Swann's Way
7178,"fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that",Swann's Way
7178,"interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and",Swann's Way
7178,"that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses",Swann's Way
7178,"that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as",Swann's Way
7178,those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful,Swann's Way
7178,curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in,Swann's Way
7178,himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to,Swann's Way
7178,"regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step",Swann's Way
7178,"to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of",Swann's Way
7178,"which--supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as",Swann's Way
7178,"well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life,",Swann's Way
7178,"the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's",Swann's Way
7178,intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's,Swann's Way
7178,"disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be",Swann's Way
7178,"discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members--is no",Swann's Way
7178,"longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the",Swann's Way
7178,"philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external",Swann's Way
7178,"objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years",Swann's Way
7178,already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they,Swann's Way
7178,"can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will",Swann's Way
7178,"deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence",Swann's Way
7178,which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed,Swann's Way
7178,it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived,Swann's Way
7178,"from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the",Swann's Way
7178,impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate,Swann's Way
7178,"in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with",Swann's Way
7178,"regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of",Swann's Way
7178,"which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the",Swann's Way
7178,gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be,Swann's Way
7178,"expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for",Swann's Way
7178,"collecting things, or for good cooking.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged",Swann's Way
7178,"him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him",Swann's Way
7178,by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to,Swann's Way
7178,"that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little",Swann's Way
7178,"incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we",Swann's Way
7178,should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by,Swann's Way
7178,"those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching,",Swann's Way
7178,whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed.,Swann's Way
7178,"She kept on saying: ""What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come",Swann's Way
7178,"in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you."" He knew",Swann's Way
7178,very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so,Swann's Way
7178,"keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a",Swann's Way
7178,"good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when",Swann's Way
7178,"she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that",Swann's Way
7178,"she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a",Swann's Way
7178,matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began,Swann's Way
7178,"at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was",Swann's Way
7178,"usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken",Swann's Way
7178,"expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief",Swann's Way
7178,"too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to",Swann's Way
7178,"play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He",Swann's Way
7178,"had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could",Swann's Way
7178,"no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had",Swann's Way
7178,"lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner",Swann's Way
7178,"from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so",Swann's Way
7178,"that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most",Swann's Way
7178,"scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent",Swann's Way
7178,"a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and",Swann's Way
7178,served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most,Swann's Way
7178,"terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when",Swann's Way
7178,"she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for",Swann's Way
7178,"her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer",Swann's Way
7178,"exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She",Swann's Way
7178,"knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the",Swann's Way
7178,"man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at",Swann's Way
7178,his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and,Swann's Way
7178,"culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant,",Swann's Way
7178,"social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it",Swann's Way
7178,"recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent",Swann's Way
7178,with a consciousness of wrongdoing.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give",Swann's Way
7178,"her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead",Swann's Way
7178,for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what,Swann's Way
7178,"had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him,",Swann's Way
7178,"but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet",Swann's Way
7178,"happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would",Swann's Way
7178,"throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the",Swann's Way
7178,"front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words",Swann's Way
7178,dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a",Swann's Way
7178,universal despair.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as",Swann's Way
7178,though some one were going away--probably the person whom Swann must on,Swann's Way
7178,"no account meet--after being told that Odette was not at home. And then,",Swann's Way
7178,"when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in",Swann's Way
7178,"the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of",Swann's Way
7178,"which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement",Swann's Way
7178,"that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards",Swann's Way
7178,"her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt",Swann's Way
7178,"for her only, and murmured: ""Poor darling!"" When finally he left her,",Swann's Way
7178,"she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him",Swann's Way
7178,if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the,Swann's Way
7178,"post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each",Swann's Way
7178,"of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen,",Swann's Way
7178,"except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. ""If",Swann's Way
7178,"I saw what was in this,"" he argued, ""I should know what she calls him,",Swann's Way
7178,"what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them.",Swann's Way
7178,"Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which",Swann's Way
7178,"is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her",Swann's Way
7178,"suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter",Swann's Way
7178,"is posted.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter",Swann's Way
7178,"in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the",Swann's Way
7178,envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish,Swann's Way
7178,"nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the",Swann's Way
7178,"stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper,",Swann's Way
7178,"to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If,",Swann's Way
7178,instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to,Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed",Swann's Way
7178,"to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender",Swann's Way
7178,"kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the",Swann's Way
7178,"envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger",Swann's Way
7178,"and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the",Swann's Way
7178,"envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was",Swann's Way
7178,possible to read.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not,Swann's Way
7178,"that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the",Swann's Way
7178,"letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had",Swann's Way
7178,nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's,Swann's Way
7178,"uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"was right,"" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing,",Swann's Way
7178,"until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher,",Swann's Way
7178,"came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: ""I was right to",Swann's Way
7178,"open the door; it was my uncle."" To open the door! Then Forcheville had",Swann's Way
7178,"been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence",Swann's Way
7178,the sound that Swann had heard.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for,Swann's Way
7178,"having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him",Swann's Way
7178,"that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she",Swann's Way
7178,had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had,Swann's Way
7178,"added: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let",Swann's Way
7178,"you have that back."" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion",Swann's Way
7178,"that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was",Swann's Way
7178,obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse,Swann's Way
7178,"treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him",Swann's Way
7178,believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that,Swann's Way
7178,"he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose",Swann's Way
7178,"sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing",Swann's Way
7178,"between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once,",Swann's Way
7178,"why have said, ""I was right to open the door; it was my uncle."" Right?",Swann's Way
7178,if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville,Swann's Way
7178,possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at",Swann's Way
7178,"this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so",Swann's Way
7178,absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window,Swann's Way
7178,"there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the",Swann's Way
7178,"life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into",Swann's Way
7178,its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the,Swann's Way
7178,"discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence,",Swann's Way
7178,"fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its",Swann's Way
7178,"vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in",Swann's Way
7178,"store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over",Swann's Way
7178,"the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could",Swann's Way
7178,seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's,Swann's Way
7178,affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on,Swann's Way
7178,"it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she",Swann's Way
7178,"passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him",Swann's Way
7178,"from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at",Swann's Way
7178,"first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which",Swann's Way
7178,"an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose",Swann's Way
7178,"that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus",Swann's Way
7178,"which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle,",Swann's Way
7178,"fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in",Swann's Way
7178,"the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was",Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the",Swann's Way
7178,perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He",Swann's Way
7178,"decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a",Swann's Way
7178,few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every,Swann's Way
7178,"male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so",Swann's Way
7178,"he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new",Swann's Way
7178,"people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human",Swann's Way
7178,society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have,Swann's Way
7178,"turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate",Swann's Way
7178,desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's,Swann's Way
7178,"character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the",Swann's Way
7178,outward signs by which that character had been intelligible.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's,Swann's Way
7178,"letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were",Swann's Way
7178,giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of,Swann's Way
7178,"whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests,",Swann's Way
7178,and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to,Swann's Way
7178,"a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the",Swann's Way
7178,"painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: ""There must be no lights",Swann's Way
7178,"of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us",Swann's Way
7178,"to see by.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that",Swann's Way
7178,expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and,Swann's Way
7178,"to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the",Swann's Way
7178,"listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching",Swann's Way
7178,"signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence,",Swann's Way
7178,"an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder,",Swann's Way
7178,the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who,Swann's Way
7178,"have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have",Swann's Way
7178,"been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had",Swann's Way
7178,decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of,Swann's Way
7178,"life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated",Swann's Way
7178,"him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he",Swann's Way
7178,"drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her",Swann's Way
7178,"promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she",Swann's Way
7178,"would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her",Swann's Way
7178,arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were,Swann's Way
7178,ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,"" trying, by the",Swann's Way
7178,"friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent",Swann's Way
7178,"him from noticing that she was not saying, as she would always have",Swann's Way
7178,until then:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after."" M. and Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up,Swann's Way
7178,"behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into",Swann's Way
7178,his own.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Odette, we'll take you,"" said Mme. Verdurin, ""we've kept a little",Swann's Way
7178,"corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes, Mme. Verdurin,"" said Odette meekly.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What! I thought I was to take you home,"" cried Swann, flinging",Swann's Way
7178,"discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was",Swann's Way
7178,"precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like",Swann's Way
7178,"this dozens of times,"" said Mme. Verdurin.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But I had something important to tell Mme. de Crécy.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Very well, you can write it to her instead.""",Swann's Way

7178,dejected.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with",Swann's Way
7178,"us?"" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. ""I was",Swann's Way
7178,"afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say,",Swann's Way
7178,"straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the",Swann's Way
7178,"time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about",Swann's Way
7178,"it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me."" A moment",Swann's Way
7178,"later she added, inarticulate with rage: ""No, but, don't you see, the",Swann's Way
7178,"filthy creature..."" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of",Swann's Way
7178,the same obscure need to justify herself--like Françoise at Combray when,Swann's Way
7178,the chicken refused to die--the very words which the last convulsions of,Swann's Way
7178,an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is,Swann's Way
7178,engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved,Swann's Way
7178,"on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his",Swann's Way
7178,"face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through",Swann's Way
7178,"the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in",Swann's Way
7178,the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt,Swann's Way
7178,when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the,Swann's Way
7178,"magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles,",Swann's Way
7178,the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found,Swann's Way
7178,"them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the",Swann's Way
7178,"Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed",Swann's Way
7178,"to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with",Swann's Way
7178,"a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid",Swann's Way
7178,"bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the",Swann's Way
7178,"party next evening at Chatou. ""Imagine going to Chatou, of all places!",Swann's Way
7178,"Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are",Swann's Way
7178,sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have,Swann's Way
7178,"come out of one of Labiche's plays!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. ""Could anything be more",Swann's Way
7178,"grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one",Swann's Way
7178,"another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul",Swann's Way
7178,"they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at _Chatou_!""",Swann's Way
7178,"Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed",Swann's Way
7178,"match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his",Swann's Way
7178,"studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country,",Swann's Way
7178,"""for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a",Swann's Way
7178,"fool!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner,",Swann's Way
7178,"jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed,",Swann's Way
7178,"had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them,",Swann's Way
7178,"laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that",Swann's Way
7178,"it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. ""What a fetid",Swann's Way
7178,"form of humour!"" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of",Swann's Way
7178,disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen,Swann's Way
7178,"against his collar. ""How, in God's name, can a creature made in His",Swann's Way
7178,image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The,Swann's Way
7178,least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale,Swann's Way
7178,exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is,Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at",Swann's Way
7178,the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand,Swann's Way
7178,"to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be",Swann's Way
7178,"impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell",Swann's Way
7178,so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin,Swann's Way
7178,"sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot",Swann's Way
7178,"possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!"" he cried,",Swann's Way
7178,"tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. ""God knows",Swann's Way
7178,"that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to",Swann's Way
7178,teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has,Swann's Way
7178,"its limits, and mine is at an end,"" he concluded, as though this sacred",Swann's Way
7178,mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from,Swann's Way
7178,"longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only",Swann's Way
7178,"since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be",Swann's Way
7178,"directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from",Swann's Way
7178,him.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and",Swann's Way
7178,"the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking",Swann's Way
7178,"of her nerves by Beethoven's music. ""Idiot, liar!"" he shouted, ""and a",Swann's Way
7178,"creature like that imagines that she's fond of _Art_!"" She would say to",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville,",Swann's Way
7178,"as she had so often done for himself: ""You can make room for M. de",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?""... '""In the dark!' Codfish!",Swann's Way
7178,"Pander!""... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which",Swann's Way
7178,"would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each",Swann's Way
7178,"other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was",Swann's Way
7178,"much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards",Swann's Way
7178,"the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of",Swann's Way
7178,education in France.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so",Swann's Way
7178,"often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form",Swann's Way
7178,"of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society.",Swann's Way
7178,"""It really is,"" he repeated, ""beneath the lowest rung of the social",Swann's Way

7178,"and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority",Swann's Way

7178,"an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something",Swann's Way
7178,"complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type;",Swann's Way
7178,"they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God,",Swann's Way
7178,it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse,Swann's Way
7178,"with such infamy, such dung.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so",Swann's Way
7178,"earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the",Swann's Way
7178,"Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured",Swann's Way
7178,"and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication",Swann's Way
7178,"in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which,",Swann's Way
7178,"even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could",Swann's Way
7178,have come to him from Odette alone;--so the immorality (had it really,Swann's Way
7178,"existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless,",Swann's Way
7178,"if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to",Swann's Way
7178,unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.',Swann's Way
7178,Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it,Swann's Way
7178,refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their,Swann's Way
7178,"circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an",Swann's Way
7178,"artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen",Swann's Way

7178,"this time, was quite natural; ""I believe I have found a way of getting",Swann's Way
7178,"invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!"" But it must have been a",Swann's Way
7178,"bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been",Swann's Way

7178,"""Oh--oh--oh--oh--oh!"" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his",Swann's Way
7178,"forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the",Swann's Way

7178,at the Verdurins'.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together,Swann's Way
7178,became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to,Swann's Way

7178,"but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting",Swann's Way
7178,"with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now",Swann's Way
7178,"exasperated him. ""Yet I'm not really angry,"" he assured himself, ""when I",Swann's Way
7178,see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that,Swann's Way
7178,"dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her;",Swann's Way
7178,"disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in",Swann's Way

7178,"Victor Massé! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the",Swann's Way
7178,stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with,Swann's Way
7178,the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego,Swann's Way
7178,an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to,Swann's Way
7178,"say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what",Swann's Way
7178,she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and,Swann's Way

7178,spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening,Swann's Way
7178,"instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same line of",Swann's Way
7178,"reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had",Swann's Way
7178,"used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was",Swann's Way
7178,yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I swear to you,"" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the",Swann's Way
7178,"theatre, ""that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a",Swann's Way

7178,"after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my",Swann's Way

7178,"judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your _Nuit de",Swann's Way

7178,"incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone",Swann's Way
7178,"love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at",Swann's Way
7178,least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle,Swann's Way
7178,"down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable",Swann's Way
7178,"of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to",Swann's Way
7178,"dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always",Swann's Way
7178,mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the,Swann's Way
7178,"effect--I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you,",Swann's Way
7178,"that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my",Swann's Way
7178,"eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath",Swann's Way
7178,everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself,Swann's Way
7178,"one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as",Swann's Way
7178,"though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your",Swann's Way
7178,_Nuit de Cléopâtre_ (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject,Swann's Way
7178,"a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since",Swann's Way
7178,"I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue",Swann's Way
7178,"depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due",Swann's Way
7178,"warning.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty.",Swann's Way
7178,"Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it",Swann's Way
7178,"was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes",Swann's Way
7178,"which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying",Swann's Way
7178,"any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not",Swann's Way
7178,"make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in",Swann's Way
7178,"love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in",Swann's Way
7178,"love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost",Swann's Way
7178,"tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if",Swann's Way
7178,"he went on speaking for any length of time she would ""never"" as she told",Swann's Way
7178,"him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, ""get there in",Swann's Way
7178,"time for the Overture.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which,",Swann's Way
7178,"more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her",Swann's Way
7178,"refusal to abandon the habit of lying. ""Even from the point of view of",Swann's Way
7178,"coquetry, pure and simple,"" he had told her, ""can't you see how much",Swann's Way
7178,of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank,Swann's Way
7178,"admission--how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less",Swann's Way
7178,"intelligent than I supposed!"" In vain, however, did Swann expound to",Swann's Way
7178,her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have,Swann's Way
7178,"succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not",Swann's Way
7178,"telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only",Swann's Way
7178,as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide,Swann's Way
7178,"whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which,",Swann's Way
7178,"too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,discovering that she had not told him the truth.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was",Swann's Way
7178,"growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised,",Swann's Way
7178,"wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished",Swann's Way
7178,"with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to",Swann's Way
7178,Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking.,Swann's Way
7178,"He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm",Swann's Way
7178,which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the,Swann's Way
7178,"knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and",Swann's Way
7178,"evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever,",Swann's Way
7178,"to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two",Swann's Way
7178,"years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that",Swann's Way
7178,"would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily",Swann's Way
7178,endured on her account.,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until",Swann's Way

7178,first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must,Swann's Way
7178,"warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message",Swann's Way
7178,"for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could",Swann's Way
7178,"not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without",Swann's Way
7178,compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days,Swann's Way
7178,"on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to",Swann's Way
7178,"Compiègne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the",Swann's Way

7178,"of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of",Swann's Way
7178,Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge,Swann's Way
7178,"of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any",Swann's Way
7178,"particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose",Swann's Way

7178,"allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for,",Swann's Way
7178,"as she said, that would ""create a dreadful impression,""--he would plunge",Swann's Way
7178,"into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway",Swann's Way
7178,"timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the",Swann's Way
7178,"afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than",Swann's Way
7178,"that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the",Swann's Way
7178,"time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the",Swann's Way
7178,"public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that",Swann's Way
7178,at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which,Swann's Way
7178,"arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds",Swann's Way
7178,"was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous;",Swann's Way
7178,"an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether",Swann's Way
7178,"different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never",Swann's Way
7178,"even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified",Swann's Way
7178,the labour and expense of stoking the engines.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to,Swann's Way
7178,Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found,Swann's Way
7178,"that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he,",Swann's Way
7178,"like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long",Swann's Way
7178,time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of,Swann's Way
7178,"Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was,",Swann's Way
7178,he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of,Swann's Way
7178,Compiègne.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access",Swann's Way
7178,"to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down",Swann's Way
7178,"there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that",Swann's Way
7178,"very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one",Swann's Way
7178,"who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure:",Swann's Way
7178,"""What, you here?"" and would have invited him to come and see her at the",Swann's Way
7178,"hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand,",Swann's Way
7178,"it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed,",Swann's Way
7178,"would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in",Swann's Way
7178,"consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him.",Swann's Way
7178,"""So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!"" she",Swann's Way
7178,"would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who",Swann's Way
7178,was not allowed to go.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiègne and",Swann's Way
7178,Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis",Swann's Way
7178,"de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This",Swann's Way
7178,"friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its",Swann's Way
7178,"ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his",Swann's Way
7178,"astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come",Swann's Way
7178,"down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish",Swann's Way
7178,"to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for",Swann's Way
7178,walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there,Swann's Way
7178,"already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did",Swann's Way
7178,"not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on",Swann's Way
7178,"that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she",Swann's Way
7178,"was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility",Swann's Way
7178,"of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Château, now",Swann's Way
7178,beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to,Swann's Way
7178,"visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic;",Swann's Way
7178,"down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of",Swann's Way
7178,"sunset;--innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly",Swann's Way
7178,"simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his",Swann's Way
7178,"happy, vagabond and divided heart. ""We mustn't, on any account,"" he",Swann's Way
7178,"would warn M. de Forestelle, ""run across Odette and the Verdurins. I",Swann's Way
7178,"have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One",Swann's Way
7178,has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while,Swann's Way
7178,"coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them."" And",Swann's Way
7178,"his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place,",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the",Swann's Way
7178,dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne without being able to make,Swann's Way
7178,"up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no",Swann's Way
7178,"trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had",Swann's Way
7178,"claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment",Swann's Way
7178,"he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have",Swann's Way
7178,"hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had",Swann's Way
7178,"seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was",Swann's Way
7178,"not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at",Swann's Way
7178,once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de,Swann's Way
7178,"Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused",Swann's Way
7178,"himself: ""No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see,",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette is there."" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling",Swann's Way
7178,"that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds",Swann's Way
7178,"that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who",Swann's Way
7178,"differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction",Swann's Way
7178,which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely,Swann's Way
7178,"where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that",Swann's Way
7178,"love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a",Swann's Way
7178,"quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his",Swann's Way
7178,"days in poring over a map of the forest of Compiègne, as though it",Swann's Way
7178,had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with,Swann's Way
7178,photographs of the Château of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which,Swann's Way
7178,"it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table",Swann's Way
7178,"again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have",Swann's Way
7178,"postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He",Swann's Way
7178,"did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go",Swann's Way
7178,"to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise",Swann's Way
7178,him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed,Swann's Way
7178,"some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he",Swann's Way
7178,"leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for",Swann's Way
7178,in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to,Swann's Way
7178,"deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was",Swann's Way
7178,not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant,Swann's Way
7178,"rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any",Swann's Way
7178,"attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming",Swann's Way
7178,"nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the",Swann's Way
7178,"distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no",Swann's Way
7178,"purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had",Swann's Way
7178,been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not,Swann's Way
7178,knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a,Swann's Way
7178,"theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments",Swann's Way
7178,"as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value",Swann's Way
7178,"to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For",Swann's Way
7178,in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had,Swann's Way
7178,"once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on",Swann's Way
7178,the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had,Swann's Way
7178,"hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards,",Swann's Way
7178,at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings,Swann's Way
7178,"that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them",Swann's Way
7178,"without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty",Swann's Way
7178,a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a,Swann's Way
7178,case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he,Swann's Way
7178,"would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many",Swann's Way
7178,pickpockets. But their faces--a collective and formless mass--escaped,Swann's Way
7178,"the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his",Swann's Way
7178,"jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand",Swann's Way
7178,"over his eyes, he cried out: ""Heaven help me!"" as people, after lashing",Swann's Way
7178,themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the,Swann's Way
7178,"problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality",Swann's Way
7178,"of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning",Swann's Way
7178,"act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly,",Swann's Way
7178,indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily,Swann's Way
7178,"life--when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or",Swann's Way
7178,to bed--by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions,Swann's Way
7178,"without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of",Swann's Way
7178,"Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of",Swann's Way
7178,"staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off,",Swann's Way
7178,"to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of",Swann's Way
7178,"its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons,",Swann's Way
7178,"at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this",Swann's Way
7178,"restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the",Swann's Way
7178,"street in which Odette lived: the Lapérouse. Sometimes, when she had",Swann's Way
7178,"been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before",Swann's Way
7178,she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And,Swann's Way
7178,"then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have",Swann's Way
7178,"taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little",Swann's Way
7178,"fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood;",Swann's Way
7178,"at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it",Swann's Way
7178,"would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival",Swann's Way
7178,at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of,Swann's Way
7178,"what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in",Swann's Way
7178,"her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at",Swann's Way
7178,the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled",Swann's Way
7178,and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so,Swann's Way
7178,"indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had",Swann's Way
7178,"come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been",Swann's Way
7178,convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or,Swann's Way
7178,"hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette.",Swann's Way
7178,"These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing",Swann's Way
7178,"them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe",Swann's Way
7178,"that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was",Swann's Way
7178,"also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say",Swann's Way
7178,appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that,Swann's Way
7178,"of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would",Swann's Way
7178,spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a,Swann's Way
7178,firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of,Swann's Way
7178,the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved,Swann's Way
7178,"to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, and had been dead for twenty years.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public",Swann's Way
7178,"gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally",Swann's Way
7178,"that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited--at",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of",Swann's Way
7178,the Ministries--he found himself in the same room with her. He could,Swann's Way
7178,"see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be",Swann's Way
7178,"spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures",Swann's Way
7178,"which--while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed,",Swann's Way
7178,"as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the",Swann's Way
7178,evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray--seemed illimitable to,Swann's Way
7178,"him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice,",Swann's Way
7178,he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be,Swann's Way
7178,inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety,Swann's Way
7178,"abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying",Swann's Way
7178,of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's,Swann's Way
7178,"studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom",Swann's Way
7178,"her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at",Swann's Way
7178,some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at,Swann's Way
7178,"the Bal des Incohérents, to which he trembled to think that she might be",Swann's Way
7178,going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of,Swann's Way
7178,"their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he",Swann's Way
7178,"was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these",Swann's Way
7178,"words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which",Swann's Way
7178,"had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect,",Swann's Way
7178,"made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible,",Swann's Way
7178,"but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like",Swann's Way
7178,"a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance,",Swann's Way
7178,"shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment,",Swann's Way
7178,"for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of",Swann's Way
7178,"which she had already wearied)--in these words, which Odette flung out",Swann's Way
7178,"after him as he was crossing the threshold: ""Can't you wait a minute for",Swann's Way
7178,"me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me."" It",Swann's Way
7178,was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at,Swann's Way
7178,"the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be",Swann's Way
7178,"allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann:",Swann's Way
7178,"""Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you",Swann's Way
7178,"may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay",Swann's Way
7178,"long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and",Swann's Way
7178,"he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you",Swann's Way
7178,"only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no",Swann's Way
7178,"one that really knows you, is there, except me?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her",Swann's Way
7178,"addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender",Swann's Way
7178,"words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with",Swann's Way
7178,"them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at",Swann's Way
7178,"least be polite,"" or ""Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so",Swann's Way
7178,that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm,Swann's Way
7178,"going to make you work, I can tell you,"" which proved that Odette kept",Swann's Way
7178,"herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that",Swann's Way
7178,they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a,Swann's Way
7178,smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as",Swann's Way
7178,when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting,Swann's Way
7178,"all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows",Swann's Way
7178,"which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object",Swann's Way
7178,"itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of",Swann's Way
7178,Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there,Swann's Way
7178,before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an",Swann's Way
7178,"artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of",Swann's Way
7178,concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly,Swann's Way
7178,in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory,Swann's Way
7178,"impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was",Swann's Way
7178,"not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits,",Swann's Way
7178,"but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself",Swann's Way
7178,"had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but",Swann's Way
7178,precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that,Swann's Way
7178,"the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and",Swann's Way
7178,"supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her--and which",Swann's Way
7178,"existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe,",Swann's Way
7178,"exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which",Swann's Way
7178,"he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was",Swann's Way
7178,"being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated",Swann's Way
7178,"with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing",Swann's Way
7178,"his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves",Swann's Way
7178,"were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable",Swann's Way
7178,"realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took",Swann's Way
7178,"shape and grew solid before his eyes, and at the same time they soothed",Swann's Way
7178,his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single,Swann's Way
7178,"dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if,",Swann's Way
7178,"when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du",Swann's Way
7178,"Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he",Swann's Way
7178,"had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she",Swann's Way
7178,"was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at",Swann's Way
7178,"home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to",Swann's Way
7178,do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details,Swann's Way
7178,"of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they",Swann's Way
7178,"would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have",Swann's Way
7178,"taken on--like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had",Swann's Way
7178,"absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his",Swann's Way
7178,"longing,--a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much,Swann's Way
7178,"longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere",Swann's Way
7178,favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature,Swann's Way
7178,"always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her",Swann's Way
7178,was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by,Swann's Way
7178,"the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when",Swann's Way
7178,those normal relations were established between them which would put an,Swann's Way
7178,"end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's",Swann's Way
7178,daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic,Swann's Way
7178,"interest--as he had several times, already, felt that they might be,",Swann's Way
7178,"on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her",Swann's Way
7178,letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific,Swann's Way
7178,detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study,Swann's Way
7178,"its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette",Swann's Way
7178,might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid,Swann's Way
7178,"state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a",Swann's Way
7178,"recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then",Swann's Way
7178,was.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily",Swann's Way
7178,"lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning,",Swann's Way
7178,"would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her",Swann's Way
7178,"kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the",Swann's Way
7178,"desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had",Swann's Way
7178,need of some such outlet.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine",Swann's Way
7178,"that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat",Swann's Way
7178,"watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited,",Swann's Way
7178,"while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face",Swann's Way
7178,"which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then",Swann's Way
7178,"turned away, solitary, crushed,--she must have employed, to draw",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: ""Do look at him,",Swann's Way
7178,"storming!"" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as",Swann's Way
7178,on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At such times Swann detested her. ""But I've been a fool, too,"" he would",Swann's Way
7178,"argue. ""I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the",Swann's Way
7178,"same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for",Swann's Way
7178,"I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd",Swann's Way
7178,better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think,Swann's Way
7178,"that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth",Swann's Way
7178,"for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly",Swann's Way
7178,"little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However",Swann's Way
7178,she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's,Swann's Way
7178,hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a,Swann's Way
7178,"fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as",Swann's Way
7178,"a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!"" And his hatred, like",Swann's Way
7178,"his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with",Swann's Way
7178,"urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the",Swann's Way
7178,"perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and",Swann's Way
7178,"would be able, if it turned out--as he tried to convince himself--that",Swann's Way
7178,"she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her,",Swann's Way
7178,"emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he",Swann's Way
7178,went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from,Swann's Way
7178,"her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth,",Swann's Way
7178,"but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had",Swann's Way
7178,"promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he",Swann's Way
7178,"would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have",Swann's Way
7178,"that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that",Swann's Way
7178,"vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and",Swann's Way
7178,"declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and",Swann's Way
7178,their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances,Swann's Way
7178,"of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money,",Swann's Way
7178,"she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have",Swann's Way
7178,the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not,Swann's Way
7178,a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth,Swann's Way
7178,would be a bar to his.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully",Swann's Way
7178,"rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be",Swann's Way
7178,"used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he",Swann's Way
7178,"felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily",Swann's Way
7178,"procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth,",Swann's Way
7178,"since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing",Swann's Way
7178,"between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to",Swann's Way
7178,"live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have",Swann's Way
7178,been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of,Swann's Way
7178,"organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little",Swann's Way
7178,"suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which,",Swann's Way
7178,"it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be",Swann's Way
7178,Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent,Swann's Way
7178,"it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the",Swann's Way
7178,carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter,Swann's Way
7178,how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be,Swann's Way
7178,"kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled",Swann's Way
7178,"with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had",Swann's Way
7178,become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining,",Swann's Way
7178,"crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of",Swann's Way
7178,"an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: ""Look at him storming!"" began",Swann's Way
7178,to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before,Swann's Way
7178,"him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who",Swann's Way
7178,"also turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there",Swann's Way
7178,"was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: ""You mustn't stay",Swann's Way
7178,"long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's",Swann's Way
7178,"here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!"" that same smile",Swann's Way
7178,with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy,Swann's Way
7178,"which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him",Swann's Way
7178,"in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him",Swann's Way
7178,alone.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced",Swann's Way
7178,"him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then,",Swann's Way
7178,"she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him",Swann's Way
7178,"from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his",Swann's Way
7178,"loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear",Swann's Way
7178,"to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in",Swann's Way
7178,"Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less",Swann's Way
7178,"than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of",Swann's Way
7178,"reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love,",Swann's Way
7178,but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as,Swann's Way
7178,"the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the",Swann's Way
7178,distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation,Swann's Way
7178,"of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally",Swann's Way
7178,returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment,Swann's Way
7178,"driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her",Swann's Way
7178,"to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards,Swann's Way
7178,"her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and",Swann's Way
7178,"he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly",Swann's Way
7178,"glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it",Swann's Way
7178,had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to,Swann's Way
7178,satisfy his desire.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate,Swann's Way
7178,"reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to",Swann's Way
7178,"make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her.",Swann's Way
7178,"Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women,",Swann's Way
7178,"to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling",Swann's Way
7178,no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever,Swann's Way
7178,came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with,Swann's Way
7178,"regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy",Swann's Way
7178,"alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in",Swann's Way
7178,"this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike",Swann's Way
7178,ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be,Swann's Way
7178,"able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for",Swann's Way
7178,"their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He returned to the other point of view--opposite to that of his love,Swann's Way
7178,"and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental",Swann's Way
7178,"equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities--from",Swann's Way
7178,"which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the",Swann's Way
7178,"supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him",Swann's Way
7178,"just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he",Swann's Way
7178,"himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from",Swann's Way
7178,"him, and warped against him.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or,Swann's Way
7178,with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with,Swann's Way
7178,"him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements?",Swann's Way
7178,"At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought",Swann's Way
7178,"of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great",Swann's Way
7178,"deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make",Swann's Way
7178,"way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a",Swann's Way
7178,"triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had",Swann's Way
7178,engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going,Swann's Way
7178,"there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was",Swann's Way
7178,"quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by",Swann's Way
7178,"his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by",Swann's Way
7178,"him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those",Swann's Way
7178,"people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would",Swann's Way
7178,have had to acknowledge her indebtedness.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And if--instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him,",Swann's Way
7178,"without having seen him again--he were to send her this money, if he",Swann's Way
7178,"were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to",Swann's Way
7178,"make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him,",Swann's Way
7178,"happy, grateful, and he would have the joy--the sight of her face--which",Swann's Way
7178,"he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could",Swann's Way
7178,replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her,Swann's Way
7178,"without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in",Swann's Way
7178,"her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was",Swann's Way
7178,"no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again",Swann's Way
7178,"became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's",Swann's Way
7178,"person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one",Swann's Way
7178,"might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the",Swann's Way
7178,"birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the",Swann's Way
7178,"utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different",Swann's Way
7178,"from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which",Swann's Way
7178,"she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as",Swann's Way
7178,"disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which",Swann's Way
7178,"characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness,",Swann's Way
7178,the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of,Swann's Way
7178,"spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this",Swann's Way
7178,"unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate",Swann's Way
7178,"health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and",Swann's Way
7178,seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:--this,Swann's Way
7178,"other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible,",Swann's Way
7178,"material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created",Swann's Way
7178,"jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity",Swann's Way
7178,"for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind.",Swann's Way
7178,He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to,Swann's Way
7178,"come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured",Swann's Way
7178,"for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her",Swann's Way
7178,face and moulding her smile.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days,",Swann's Way
7178,"as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a",Swann's Way
7178,"reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him,",Swann's Way
7178,"or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her,",Swann's Way
7178,the favours by which he set most store.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during,Swann's Way
7178,"their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any",Swann's Way
7178,"money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not",Swann's Way
7178,"realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate",Swann's Way
7178,"with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future",Swann's Way
7178,"relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that",Swann's Way
7178,"a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time",Swann's Way
7178,before going to see her again.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no",Swann's Way
7178,"fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her,",Swann's Way
7178,"he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more",Swann's Way
7178,"probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in",Swann's Way
7178,"which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and",Swann's Way
7178,would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested.,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of",Swann's Way
7178,"those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief,",Swann's Way
7178,"again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of",Swann's Way
7178,"agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which",Swann's Way
7178,he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run,Swann's Way
7178,"to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following",Swann's Way
7178,"days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged",Swann's Way
7178,"his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had",Swann's Way
7178,entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something,Swann's Way
7178,"precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to",Swann's Way
7178,"possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving,",Swann's Way
7178,"as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there.",Swann's Way
7178,"But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not",Swann's Way
7178,"simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a",Swann's Way
7178,new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But at other times--when Odette was on the point of going away for a,Swann's Way
7178,holiday--it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the,Swann's Way
7178,"pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until",Swann's Way
7178,"her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of",Swann's Way
7178,"a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a",Swann's Way
7178,"separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was",Swann's Way
7178,"going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little",Swann's Way
7178,"sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious,",Swann's Way
7178,distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this,Swann's Way
7178,"picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break",Swann's Way
7178,"himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust",Swann's Way
7178,"it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks'",Swann's Way
7178,"separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would",Swann's Way
7178,consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it,Swann's Way
7178,was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether,Swann's Way
7178,he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an,Swann's Way
7178,"abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time",Swann's Way
7178,"than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without",Swann's Way
7178,"having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And",Swann's Way
7178,"yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or",Swann's Way
7178,"of weakness in his body,--by inciting him to regard the present as an",Swann's Way
7178,"exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which",Swann's Way
7178,prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing,Swann's Way
7178,effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come,Swann's Way
7178,when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday--suspended the,Swann's Way
7178,"action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or,",Swann's Way
7178,"without that even, the thought of some information for which he had",Swann's Way
7178,"forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she",Swann's Way
7178,"would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment,",Swann's Way
7178,whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him,Swann's Way
7178,to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without,Swann's Way
7178,"seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over",Swann's Way
7178,"again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would",Swann's Way
7178,"have done),--and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is",Swann's Way
7178,"let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea",Swann's Way
7178,"of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been",Swann's Way
7178,"attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate",Swann's Way
7178,possibilities.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so",Swann's Way
7178,"irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching",Swann's Way
7178,"the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he",Swann's Way
7178,"must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes",Swann's Way
7178,while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to,Swann's Way
7178,"her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in",Swann's Way
7178,"which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the",Swann's Way
7178,"wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by",Swann's Way
7178,"so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was",Swann's Way
7178,once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact,Swann's Way
7178,"was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the",Swann's Way
7178,"desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which",Swann's Way
7178,"had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to",Swann's Way
7178,"himself--or so, at least, he believed--that he was so easily capable of",Swann's Way
7178,"resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of",Swann's Way
7178,separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation,Swann's Way
7178,"whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back",Swann's Way
7178,"to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence,",Swann's Way
7178,"all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour",Swann's Way
7178,"during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a",Swann's Way
7178,"period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having",Swann's Way
7178,"lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted",Swann's Way
7178,"what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be",Swann's Way
7178,"sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to",Swann's Way
7178,"resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by",Swann's Way
7178,"his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps,",Swann's Way
7178,"have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result",Swann's Way
7178,that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an,Swann's Way
7178,Odette almost unknown.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was",Swann's Way
7178,"only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came,",Swann's Way
7178,"now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase",Swann's Way
7178,of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these,Swann's Way
7178,"crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed",Swann's Way
7178,"of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only",Swann's Way
7178,"to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always",Swann's Way
7178,identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more,Swann's Way
7178,"profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of",Swann's Way
7178,"view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed",Swann's Way
7178,"to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each",Swann's Way
7178,"persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event,",Swann's Way
7178,at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his,Swann's Way
7178,"inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the",Swann's Way
7178,"moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be",Swann's Way
7178,misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance,Swann's Way
7178,"to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him,",Swann's Way
7178,"assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one",Swann's Way
7178,"and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased",Swann's Way
7178,to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their,Swann's Way
7178,"dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of,Swann's Way
7178,certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether,Swann's Way
7178,to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still,Swann's Way
7178,"reasonable, or indeed possible.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge.",Swann's Way
7178,"When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it",Swann's Way
7178,"diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate",Swann's Way
7178,"liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was",Swann's Way
7178,"in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded",Swann's Way
7178,"complexion, returned on certain days. ""Really, I am making distinct",Swann's Way
7178,"headway,"" he would tell himself on the morrow, ""when I come to think it",Swann's Way
7178,"over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night,",Swann's Way
7178,"out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought",Swann's Way
7178,"her ugly."" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long",Swann's Way
7178,"way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed,",Swann's Way
7178,no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the,Swann's Way
7178,"photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he",Swann's Way
7178,"had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the",Swann's Way
7178,"pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his",Swann's Way
7178,"mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, ""It is she!"" as",Swann's Way
7178,"when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one",Swann's Way
7178,"of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are",Swann's Way
7178,"suffering. ""She?""--he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it",Swann's Way
7178,"is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague",Swann's Way
7178,"conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in",Swann's Way
7178,"question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear",Swann's Way
7178,"that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape",Swann's Way
7178,"our grasp--the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all",Swann's Way
7178,"his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his",Swann's Way
7178,"sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so",Swann's Way
7178,entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it,Swann's Way
7178,"away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case",Swann's Way
7178,was past operation.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests,Swann's Way
7178,"that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding",Swann's Way
7178,"himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting",Swann's Way
7178,(although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate,Swann's Way
7178,"of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's",Swann's Way
7178,eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his,Swann's Way
7178,"love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by",Swann's Way
7178,"seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would",Swann's Way
7178,"feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and",Swann's Way
7178,"among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were,Swann's Way
7178,"depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used",Swann's Way
7178,"to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the",Swann's Way
7178,"smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the",Swann's Way
7178,"soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of",Swann's Way
7178,"daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the",Swann's Way
7178,shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which,Swann's Way
7178,"this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which",Swann's Way
7178,Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few,Swann's Way
7178,and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his,Swann's Way
7178,"love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my",Swann's Way
7178,"great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more",Swann's Way
7178,"individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most",Swann's Way
7178,"delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de",Swann's Way
7178,"Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of,Swann's Way
7178,"thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite",Swann's Way
7178,"sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of",Swann's Way
7178,"his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written",Swann's Way
7178,"to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit",Swann's Way
7178,"at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they",Swann's Way
7178,"were, the strawberries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always",Swann's Way
7178,"had the best, am soon, ""every fruit visited and examined, one by one,",Swann's Way
7178,"by myself."" And in the sequel, by the cordiality with which the",Swann's Way
7178,"Princess thanked him, he had been able to judge of the flavour of the",Swann's Way
7178,"strawberries and of the ripeness of the pears. But, most of all, that",Swann's Way
7178,"""every fruit visited and examined one by one, by myself"" had brought",Swann's Way
7178,balm to his sufferings by carrying his mind off to a region which he,Swann's Way
7178,"rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich",Swann's Way
7178,and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from,Swann's Way
7178,generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art,Swann's Way
7178,of ordering things from shops.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to",Swann's Way
7178,"feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,"than he was capable of feeling at other times--when, indeed, he was",Swann's Way
7178,grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class,Swann's Way
7178,"people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was",Swann's Way
7178,"less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for",Swann's Way
7178,"all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from",Swann's Way
7178,"respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely",Swann's Way
7178,"entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which",Swann's Way
7178,"asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the",Swann's Way
7178,family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up',Swann's Way
7178,"with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had",Swann's Way
7178,"invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by",Swann's Way
7178,"sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the",Swann's Way
7178,"son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of",Swann's Way
7178,"them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his",Swann's Way
7178,"house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon",Swann's Way
7178,"his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid",Swann's Way
7178,"comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the",Swann's Way
7178,fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the,Swann's Way
7178,"thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the",Swann's Way
7178,"house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would",Swann's Way
7178,"be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg",Swann's Way
7178,"and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried",Swann's Way
7178,"in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so",Swann's Way
7178,exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and,Swann's Way
7178,"patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which",Swann's Way
7178,"in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually",Swann's Way
7178,"of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of",Swann's Way
7178,"all,--since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference",Swann's Way
7178,"to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed",Swann's Way
7178,"feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome",Swann's Way
7178,"to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins'",Swann's Way
7178,"'faithful,'--when he betook himself to a world in which he was the",Swann's Way
7178,"paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract,",Swann's Way
7178,"whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to",Swann's Way
7178,"believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite",Swann's Way
7178,"for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a",Swann's Way
7178,"strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an",Swann's Way
7178,official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not,Swann's Way
7178,"paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her",Swann's Way
7178,that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking,Swann's Way
7178,"himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her,",Swann's Way
7178,"it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each",Swann's Way
7178,"visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some",Swann's Way
7178,"information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually",Swann's Way
7178,"going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him.",Swann's Way
7178,"And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her",Swann's Way
7178,"at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say",Swann's Way
7178,"to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking",Swann's Way
7178,him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home,Swann's Way
7178,"in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his",Swann's Way
7178,"device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now",Swann's Way
7178,"frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her;",Swann's Way
7178,"that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, ""I am always",Swann's Way
7178,"free"" and ""What can it matter to me, what other people think?"" now,",Swann's Way
7178,"whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded",Swann's Way
7178,"some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a",Swann's Way
7178,"private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would",Swann's Way
7178,"expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that",Swann's Way
7178,he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a,Swann's Way
7178,"pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden",Swann's Way
7178,"to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply",Swann's Way
7178,"attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also",Swann's Way
7178,"had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue",Swann's Way
7178,"de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it",Swann's Way
7178,"happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my",Swann's Way
7178,"uncle, a poetical tone, saying: ""Ah, he! He is not in the least",Swann's Way
7178,"like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his",Swann's Way
7178,friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little,Swann's Way
7178,consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in,Swann's Way
7178,"public."" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what",Swann's Way
7178,rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my,Swann's Way
7178,"uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, _a priori_, the axiom",Swann's Way
7178,"of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible",Swann's Way
7178,"virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. ""I should",Swann's Way
7178,"like to speak to you about her,"" he went on, ""you, who know what a woman",Swann's Way
7178,"supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see",Swann's Way
7178,Odette in the light in which you and I have been privileged to see her.,Swann's Way
7178,And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly;,Swann's Way
7178,"she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now",Swann's Way
7178,"you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few",Swann's Way
7178,"words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerates the harm",Swann's Way
7178,"which my bowing to her in the street might do her?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she",Swann's Way
7178,would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her,Swann's Way
7178,"everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told",Swann's Way
7178,Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that,Swann's Way
7178,my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault.,Swann's Way
7178,"She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my",Swann's Way
7178,"uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met",Swann's Way
7178,"again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if",Swann's Way
7178,he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk,Swann's Way
7178,"things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to",Swann's Way
7178,throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had,Swann's Way
7178,"led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the",Swann's Way
7178,"winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one",Swann's Way
7178,"had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he",Swann's Way
7178,"would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to",Swann's Way
7178,"learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them,",Swann's Way
7178,incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted,Swann's Way
7178,"them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only,",Swann's Way
7178,"each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the",Swann's Way
7178,picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt,Swann's Way
7178,"that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would",Swann's Way
7178,"never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden",Swann's Way
7178,"or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in",Swann's Way
7178,"one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety.",Swann's Way
7178,"He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with",Swann's Way
7178,"certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their",Swann's Way
7178,"heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom,",Swann's Way
7178,"up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that",Swann's Way
7178,"pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that",Swann's Way
7178,"he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been",Swann's Way
7178,"solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no",Swann's Way
7178,"longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any",Swann's Way
7178,"moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and",Swann's Way
7178,"dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had",Swann's Way
7178,"been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's _Septennat_,",Swann's Way
7178,"in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but",Swann's Way
7178,"splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he",Swann's Way
7178,would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant,Swann's Way
7178,"details that made up the daily round on the Côte d'Azur in those days,",Swann's Way
7178,if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled,Swann's Way
7178,"him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does",Swann's Way
7178,the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century,Swann's Way
7178,"Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the",Swann's Way
7178,"Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit,",Swann's Way
7178,"often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming;",Swann's Way
7178,"and she would comment: ""You do look sad!"" It was not very long since,",Swann's Way
7178,"from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best",Swann's Way
7178,"women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and",Swann's Way
7178,"yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de",Swann's Way
7178,"Crécy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies'",Swann's Way
7178,"men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so",Swann's Way
7178,"often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself:",Swann's Way
7178,"""What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette de Crécy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true,",Swann's Way
7178,"are always based upon other people's ideas""; he would reflect that this",Swann's Way
7178,"legend--even if it were authentic--was something external to Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality;,Swann's Way
7178,that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank,Swann's Way
7178,"eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers,",Swann's Way
7178,a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he,Swann's Way
7178,"succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was,",Swann's Way
7178,"often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish",Swann's Way
7178,preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would,Swann's Way
7178,"push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would",Swann's Way
7178,"seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some",Swann's Way
7178,"worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a",Swann's Way
7178,"moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would",Swann's Way
7178,flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of,Swann's Way
7178,"her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which,",Swann's Way
7178,"suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment",Swann's Way
7178,"of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even",Swann's Way
7178,"the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have",Swann's Way
7178,shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on,Swann's Way
7178,"them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the",Swann's Way
7178,"process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the",Swann's Way
7178,"intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on",Swann's Way
7178,(as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the,Swann's Way
7178,other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments,Swann's Way
7178,"were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening",Swann's Way
7178,"meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she",Swann's Way
7178,"would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she",Swann's Way
7178,wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her.,Swann's Way
7178,She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of,Swann's Way
7178,"the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the",Swann's Way
7178,"evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she",Swann's Way
7178,would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet,Swann's Way
7178,"progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the",Swann's Way
7178,"moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with",Swann's Way
7178,"irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, plunging into",Swann's Way
7178,her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look,Swann's Way
7178,"well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair",Swann's Way
7178,"over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden",Swann's Way
7178,"tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to",Swann's Way
7178,"restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: ""So that is how",Swann's Way
7178,you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought,Swann's Way
7178,"I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!""",Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes, at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he",Swann's Way
7178,"would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive",Swann's Way
7178,"alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him.",Swann's Way
7178,"But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it",Swann's Way
7178,"was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable",Swann's Way
7178,"acquaintance, some one who knew--if only indirectly--the man with",Swann's Way
7178,"whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of",Swann's Way
7178,"information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends,",Swann's Way
7178,"asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other,",Swann's Way
7178,he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions,Swann's Way
7178,to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the,Swann's Way
7178,strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for,Swann's Way
7178,"such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us,",Swann's Way
7178,"always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know",Swann's Way
7178,"we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can",Swann's Way
7178,"dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of",Swann's Way
7178,power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was,Swann's Way
7178,with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward,Swann's Way
7178,"could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it",Swann's Way
7178,"was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty",Swann's Way
7178,about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had,Swann's Way
7178,declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see,Swann's Way
7178,"her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly",Swann's Way
7178,"to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact",Swann's Way
7178,"that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring",Swann's Way
7178,"to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing",Swann's Way
7178,"not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each",Swann's Way
7178,"of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very",Swann's Way
7178,soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of,Swann's Way
7178,dissipations.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But what do you mean, my dear Mémé, I don't quite understand.... You",Swann's Way
7178,didn't go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin? Surely you went,Swann's Way
7178,somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing,Swann's Way
7178,"you are, my dear Mémé. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat",Swann's Way
7178,"Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange.",Swann's Way
7178,"After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people",Swann's Way
7178,there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat,Swann's Way
7178,"there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you,",Swann's Way
7178,"sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I'm exceedingly",Swann's Way
7178,"fond of you.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when",Swann's Way
7178,"talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he",Swann's Way
7178,"hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance,",Swann's Way
7178,"""I saw Mme. de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.""),",Swann's Way
7178,sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid,Swann's Way
7178,"state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay",Swann's Way
7178,"there irremovable,--how charming, by way of contrast, were the words:",Swann's Way
7178,"""She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul."" How freely they",Swann's Way
7178,"coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to",Swann's Way
7178,"breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette",Swann's Way
7178,must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred,Swann's Way
7178,"to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him,",Swann's Way
7178,pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have",Swann's Way
7178,"sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's",Swann's Way
7178,"presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific",Swann's Way
7178,"which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the",Swann's Way
7178,"disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it",Swann's Way
7178,"would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her",Swann's Way
7178,"house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return,",Swann's Way
7178,"into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there,",Swann's Way
7178,"all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed",Swann's Way
7178,"spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she",Swann's Way
7178,"would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form",Swann's Way
7178,"various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage,",Swann's Way
7178,"while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his",Swann's Way
7178,"mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going",Swann's Way
7178,"to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into",Swann's Way
7178,bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready,Swann's Way
7178,"to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious,",Swann's Way
7178,"so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he",Swann's Way
7178,"burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying",Swann's Way
7178,"with a smile: ""This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic."" After",Swann's Way
7178,which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought,Swann's Way
7178,"that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This",Swann's Way
7178,"compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without",Swann's Way
7178,"result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over",Swann's Way
7178,"his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a",Swann's Way
7178,"tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with",Swann's Way
7178,"anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his",Swann's Way
7178,"life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed,",Swann's Way
7178,"at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even",Swann's Way
7178,"to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so",Swann's Way
7178,much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his,Swann's Way
7178,struggle.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no,Swann's Way
7178,"longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when",Swann's Way
7178,"at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone",Swann's Way
7178,"to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of",Swann's Way
7178,Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was,Swann's Way
7178,in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question,Swann's Way
7178,"of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new",Swann's Way
7178,developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little,Swann's Way
7178,time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even,Swann's Way
7178,days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was,Swann's Way
7178,"cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place",Swann's Way
7178,"the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were,",Swann's Way
7178,diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred,Swann's Way
7178,"from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had",Swann's Way
7178,awakened him.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important,Swann's Way
7178,matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived,Swann's Way
7178,long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything,Swann's Way
7178,else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the,Swann's Way
7178,effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would,Swann's Way
7178,"pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have",Swann's Way
7178,"wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There",Swann's Way
7178,"emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which",Swann's Way
7178,"reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some",Swann's Way
7178,"obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as",Swann's Way
7178,they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning,Swann's Way
7178,"as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the",Swann's Way
7178,"necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which",Swann's Way
7178,"she referred, from time to time, to ""the day when I go with my friend",Swann's Way
7178,"to the Hippodrome,"" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, ""Perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette would be kind and come to see me,"" he remembered, suddenly, that",Swann's Way
7178,"it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an ""Oh,",Swann's Way
7178,no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it,Swann's Way
7178,"before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome.",Swann's Way
7178,We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time,Swann's Way
7178,in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in,Swann's Way
7178,"advance."" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the",Swann's Way
7178,"Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely",Swann's Way
7178,ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed,Swann's Way
7178,to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely,Swann's Way
7178,"connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the",Swann's Way
7178,"salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied",Swann's Way
7178,to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or,Swann's Way
7178,"three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for",Swann's Way
7178,"instance, she said: ""That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the",Swann's Way
7178,"other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,"" that explanation would",Swann's Way
7178,"set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that",Swann's Way
7178,this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the,Swann's Way
7178,"Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any",Swann's Way
7178,"coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her,",Swann's Way
7178,"that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to",Swann's Way
7178,invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed,Swann's Way
7178,all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of,Swann's Way
7178,"seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He",Swann's Way
7178,"would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for",Swann's Way
7178,"queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in",Swann's Way
7178,"their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for",Swann's Way
7178,his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with,Swann's Way
7178,one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly,Swann's Way
7178,"relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity",Swann's Way
7178,of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the,Swann's Way
7178,"attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never",Swann's Way
7178,"took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker,",Swann's Way
7178,"whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been",Swann's Way
7178,"visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost",Swann's Way
7178,"slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful,",Swann's Way
7178,"nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead",Swann's Way
7178,indefinitely.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw",Swann's Way
7178,"some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon",Swann's Way
7178,Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he,Swann's Way
7178,"had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread",Swann's Way
7178,"of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the",Swann's Way
7178,"predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking",Swann's Way
7178,"contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction",Swann's Way
7178,"from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship,",Swann's Way
7178,"she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a",Swann's Way
7178,"letter to him with the words: ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can",Swann's Way
7178,"scarcely write."" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that",Swann's Way
7178,"emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to",Swann's Way
7178,enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our,Swann's Way
7178,"hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love.",Swann's Way
7178,"When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy,",Swann's Way
7178,"how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing",Swann's Way
7178,"to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had",Swann's Way
7178,"sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating",Swann's Way
7178,"opportunities for saying ""my"" and ""mine"" when she referred to him: ""You",Swann's Way
7178,"are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I",Swann's Way
7178,"shall keep it,"" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of",Swann's Way
7178,"a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days,",Swann's Way
7178,"whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: ""You know,",Swann's Way
7178,"you will never be like other people!""--she would gaze at his long,",Swann's Way
7178,"slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes",Swann's Way
7178,"used to think: ""He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is",Swann's Way
7178,"smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!"" and, with more curiosity",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress,",Swann's Way
7178,she would sigh:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes",Swann's Way
7178,"of irritation, sometimes indulgent: ""Ah! so you never will be like other",Swann's Way
7178,"people!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent",Swann's Way
7178,"anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process",Swann's Way
7178,which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music,Swann's Way
7178,"of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child",Swann's Way
7178,"whose family one has known: ""He's not positively ugly, if you like,",Swann's Way
7178,"but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!""",Swann's Way
7178,"realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible",Swann's Way
7178,"boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent",Swann's Way
7178,"lover from a cuckold's), and would say:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of",Swann's Way
7178,"yours.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling",Swann's Way
7178,"himself greedily upon her words: ""You can if you like,"" he would tell",Swann's Way
7178,her.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to",Swann's Way
7178,"make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women",Swann's Way
7178,"asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though",Swann's Way
7178,it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble,Swann's Way
7178,task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and,Swann's Way
7178,"intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. ""If she didn't love me,",Swann's Way
7178,"just a little,"" he told himself, ""she would not wish to have me altered.",Swann's Way
7178,"To alter me, she will have to see me more often."" And so he was able to",Swann's Way
7178,"trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of",Swann's Way
7178,"her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so",Swann's Way
7178,"little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of",Swann's Way
7178,"her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she",Swann's Way
7178,forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his,Swann's Way
7178,"coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and,",Swann's Way
7178,"anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders",Swann's Way
7178,which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her,Swann's Way
7178,"say: ""Don't have him again when you come to me,"" just as he might have",Swann's Way
7178,"wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he",Swann's Way
7178,"was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom",Swann's Way
7178,he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the,Swann's Way
7178,"most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never",Swann's Way
7178,"heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to",Swann's Way
7178,him:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now,",Swann's Way
7178,"and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his",Swann's Way
7178,"carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way,",Swann's Way
7178,"his friend said: ""Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?"" with what",Swann's Way
7178,melancholy joy would Swann answer him:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I",Swann's Way
7178,"go to the Rue La Pérouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she",Swann's Way
7178,"thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know,",Swann's Way
7178,"women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to",Swann's Way
7178,"take Rémi there; I should never hear the last of it!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now",Swann's Way
7178,"adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise",Swann's Way
7178,"how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day",Swann's Way
7178,"after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly",Swann's Way
7178,contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he,Swann's Way
7178,could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now,Swann's Way
7178,"this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and",Swann's Way
7178,"night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it,",Swann's Way
7178,he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made,Swann's Way
7178,"to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: ""There",Swann's Way
7178,"was a time when Odette loved me more,"" but he never formed any definite",Swann's Way
7178,picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he,Swann's Way
7178,"contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever",Swann's Way
7178,"he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked",Swann's Way
7178,away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first,Swann's Way
7178,"evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in",Swann's Way
7178,"which she said: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never",Swann's Way
7178,"have let you have that back,"" and ""At whatever hour of the day or night",Swann's Way
7178,"you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,""",Swann's Way
7178,so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his,Swann's Way
7178,"thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by",Swann's Way
7178,a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within,Swann's Way
7178,reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone,Swann's Way
7178,out to a party.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season,",Swann's Way
7178,of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians,Swann's Way
7178,"who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had",Swann's Way
7178,"intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never",Swann's Way
7178,"been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this",Swann's Way
7178,"party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to",Swann's Way
7178,"go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in",Swann's Way
7178,"helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a",Swann's Way
7178,little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the",Swann's Way
7178,greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead,Swann's Way
7178,to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I,Swann's Way
7178,"don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to",Swann's Way
7178,"see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went",Swann's Way
7178,"with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try",Swann's Way
7178,"to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you",Swann's Way
7178,"could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something",Swann's Way
7178,"that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for",Swann's Way
7178,"the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we",Swann's Way
7178,might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon,Swann's Way
7178,"seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or",Swann's Way
7178,"if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so,Swann's Way
7178,many thanks for all you are doing for me--you know what I feel about,Swann's Way
7178,"you!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had,Swann's Way
7178,"deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived",Swann's Way
7178,soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening,Swann's Way
7178,"in the Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to",Swann's Way
7178,"everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details",Swann's Way
7178,"of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is",Swann's Way
7178,"to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,",Swann's Way
7178,"appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the",Swann's Way
7178,foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which,Swann's Way
7178,"hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions,",Swann's Way
7178,and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and,Swann's Way
7178,"setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of",Swann's Way
7178,Balzac's 'tigers'--now 'grooms'--. who normally followed their mistress,Swann's Way
7178,"when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out",Swann's Way
7178,"of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the",Swann's Way
7178,"stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of",Swann's Way
7178,their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always,Swann's Way
7178,had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits,Swann's Way
7178,"in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more",Swann's Way
7178,"general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached",Swann's Way
7178,"from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the",Swann's Way
7178,"cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of",Swann's Way
7178,"fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in",Swann's Way
7178,"evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there,",Swann's Way
7178,"his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in",Swann's Way
7178,"it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the",Swann's Way
7178,"party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for",Swann's Way
7178,"the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest,",Swann's Way
7178,"the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen",Swann's Way
7178,"who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until,",Swann's Way
7178,"pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet",Swann's Way
7178,and gathered in a circle round about him.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the",Swann's Way
7178,"headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions,",Swann's Way
7178,"tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take",Swann's Way
7178,his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by,Swann's Way
7178,"the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his",Swann's Way
7178,person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to,Swann's Way
7178,which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost,Swann's Way
7178,"over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching",Swann's Way
7178,by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of,Swann's Way
7178,"his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that",Swann's Way
7178,"overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and",Swann's Way
7178,displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of,Swann's Way
7178,its captivity.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing,",Swann's Way
7178,"motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior",Swann's Way
7178,"whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in",Swann's Way
7178,"dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and",Swann's Way
7178,bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were,Swann's Way
7178,"thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in",Swann's Way
7178,"the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as",Swann's Way
7178,if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint,Swann's Way
7178,"James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race--if,",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the",Swann's Way
7178,"frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and",Swann's Way
7178,where it still dreams--fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue,Swann's Way
7178,"by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons.",Swann's Way
7178,"And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his",Swann's Way
7178,"head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek",Swann's Way
7178,"sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which,",Swann's Way
7178,"if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to",Swann's Way
7178,"extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed,",Swann's Way
7178,"as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair,",Swann's Way
7178,"by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the",Swann's Way
7178,"overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can",Swann's Way
7178,"suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of",Swann's Way
7178,"hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal,",Swann's Way
7178,"were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their",Swann's Way
7178,"decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be",Swann's Way
7178,"named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the",Swann's Way
7178,"'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by",Swann's Way
7178,"the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would",Swann's Way
7178,"he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck",Swann's Way
7178,"flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly",Swann's Way
7178,have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to,Swann's Way
7178,"spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the",Swann's Way
7178,"privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in",Swann's Way
7178,"the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account,",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his,Swann's Way
7178,"mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything",Swann's Way
7178,"that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to",Swann's Way
7178,"the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the",Swann's Way
7178,"building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed",Swann's Way
7178,"milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat;",Swann's Way
7178,"on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment",Swann's Way
7178,"climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each",Swann's Way
7178,anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or,Swann's Way
7178,"the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor",Swann's Way
7178,"service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests,",Swann's Way
7178,"a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest",Swann's Way
7178,"of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the",Swann's Way
7178,"plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate),",Swann's Way
7178,scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had,Swann's Way
7178,been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant,Swann's Way
7178,"livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not",Swann's Way
7178,"feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway,",Swann's Way
7178,"their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like",Swann's Way
7178,"saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard",Swann's Way
7178,"fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff",Swann's Way
7178,"as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up",Swann's Way
7178,which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and,Swann's Way
7178,"a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's",Swann's Way
7178,"sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in",Swann's Way
7178,"which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers,",Swann's Way
7178,rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a,Swann's Way
7178,little hall which--just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners,Swann's Way
7178,to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they,Swann's Way
7178,"take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else",Swann's Way
7178,"besides--displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy",Swann's Way
7178,"by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body",Swann's Way
7178,"slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more",Swann's Way
7178,"crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire,",Swann's Way
7178,"timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that",Swann's Way
7178,screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with,Swann's Way
7178,"his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly",Swann's Way
7178,"impassibility or a supernatural faith--an allegory of alarums,",Swann's Way
7178,"incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot--to be looking out,",Swann's Way
7178,"angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the",Swann's Way
7178,approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to,Swann's Way
7178,"enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an",Swann's Way
7178,"usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering",Swann's Way
7178,to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house,Swann's Way
7178,"in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but",Swann's Way
7178,"permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a",Swann's Way
7178,door-mat wrung his heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human,Swann's Way
7178,"male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of",Swann's Way
7178,the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of,Swann's Way
7178,"faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new",Swann's Way
7178,"and uncanny, now that their features,--instead of being to him symbols",Swann's Way
7178,"of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who",Swann's Way
7178,"until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after,",Swann's Way
7178,"boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged--were at rest,",Swann's Way
7178,"measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their",Swann's Way
7178,"curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now",Swann's Way

7178,"of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted",Swann's Way
7178,"to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not",Swann's Way
7178,now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because,Swann's Way
7178,"he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who",Swann's Way
7178,"were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two",Swann's Way
7178,"figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who",Swann's Way
7178,"had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the",Swann's Way

7178,"left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops,",Swann's Way
7178,appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious,Swann's Way
7178,"to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while",Swann's Way

7178,"glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the",Swann's Way
7178,"microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and",Swann's Way
7178,"never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness",Swann's Way
7178,"of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of",Swann's Way

7178,"concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away,",Swann's Way
7178,"went on, ""You're looking well, old man!"" while M. de Bréauté turned",Swann's Way
7178,"with, ""My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?"" to a 'society",Swann's Way
7178,novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his,Swann's Way
7178,"own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological",Swann's Way
7178,"investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now",Swann's Way
7178,"replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':--""I am",Swann's Way
7178,"observing!""",Swann's Way

7178,enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it,Swann's Way
7178,"was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there",Swann's Way
7178,"was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a",Swann's Way
7178,"melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering",Swann's Way
7178,"terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like",Swann's Way
7178,"Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which",Swann's Way
7178,"composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while",Swann's Way
7178,his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their,Swann's Way
7178,grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled,Swann's Way
7178,"in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing",Swann's Way

7178,Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from _Orfeo_ which was,Swann's Way
7178,"being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner",Swann's Way
7178,"from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of",Swann's Way
7178,"'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the",Swann's Way
7178,"Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend",Swann's Way
7178,"their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her",Swann's Way
7178,"bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at",Swann's Way
7178,"a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved,",Swann's Way
7178,"by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs;",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more",Swann's Way
7178,"glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary,",Swann's Way
7178,"was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all",Swann's Way
7178,her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure,Swann's Way
7178,country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled,Swann's Way
7178,"with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the",Swann's Way
7178,pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds'),Swann's Way
7178,"which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy",Swann's Way
7178,"flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head,",Swann's Way
7178,as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were,Swann's Way
7178,"a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing,",Swann's Way
7178,"a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of",Swann's Way
7178,"astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: ""It isn't",Swann's Way
7178,"possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all",Swann's Way
7178,"that!""; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical",Swann's Way
7178,"education, beating time with her head--transformed for the nonce into",Swann's Way
7178,"the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements",Swann's Way
7178,from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild,Swann's Way
7178,abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to,Swann's Way
7178,"analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely ""I can't",Swann's Way
7178,"help it"") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught",Swann's Way
7178,"in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the",Swann's Way
7178,"bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any",Swann's Way
7178,interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side,Swann's Way
7178,"(and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de",Swann's Way
7178,"Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own",Swann's Way
7178,"kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly",Swann's Way
7178,"and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most",Swann's Way
7178,"brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a",Swann's Way
7178,"scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the",Swann's Way
7178,"family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself",Swann's Way
7178,"seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment",Swann's Way
7178,"next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that",Swann's Way
7178,her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made,Swann's Way
7178,"externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a",Swann's Way
7178,vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he,Swann's Way
7178,is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact,Swann's Way
7178,"that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young",Swann's Way
7178,"cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already",Swann's Way
7178,elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with,Swann's Way
7178,"anger--and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who",Swann's Way
7178,"expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it",Swann's Way
7178,was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there--a,Swann's Way
7178,"degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists,",Swann's Way
7178,"would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that",Swann's Way
7178,this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She,Swann's Way
7178,"remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des",Swann's Way
7178,"Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in",Swann's Way
7178,"a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly",Swann's Way
7178,"humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, ""After all, it isn't for me to",Swann's Way
7178,"take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is."" And",Swann's Way
7178,fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back,Swann's Way
7178,"until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which",Swann's Way
7178,"lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head",Swann's Way
7178,of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its,Swann's Way
7178,"feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having",Swann's Way
7178,been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but,Swann's Way
7178,"successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may",Swann's Way
7178,observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice,Swann's Way
7178,and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she,Swann's Way
7178,"was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level",Swann's Way
7178,"with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that",Swann's Way
7178,it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride,Swann's Way
7178,"that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually",Swann's Way
7178,"remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was",Swann's Way
7178,"accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at",Swann's Way
7178,"times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs.",Swann's Way
7178,Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of,Swann's Way
7178,analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms,Swann's Way
7178,"would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at",Swann's Way
7178,"once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms",Swann's Way
7178,"of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as ""at my cousins the",Swann's Way
7178,"Guermantes's,"" ""at my aunt Guermantes's,"" ""Elzéar de Guermantes's",Swann's Way
7178,"health,"" ""my cousin Guermantes's box."" If anyone spoke to her of a",Swann's Way
7178,"distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not",Swann's Way
7178,"personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at",Swann's Way
7178,"her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone,",Swann's Way
7178,"with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if",Swann's Way
7178,she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the,Swann's Way
7178,"obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders",Swann's Way
7178,"were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which",Swann's Way
7178,gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of,Swann's Way
7178,our chests.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to",Swann's Way
7178,"appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To",Swann's Way
7178,"shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which",Swann's Way
7178,"she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior",Swann's Way
7178,"rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides,",Swann's Way
7178,"even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting",Swann's Way
7178,"to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being",Swann's Way
7178,"in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at",Swann's Way
7178,the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his,Swann's Way
7178,coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision--so as not to seem to,Swann's Way
7178,be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her,Swann's Way
7178,"due--to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she",Swann's Way
7178,stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and,Swann's Way
7178,"from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de",Swann's Way
7178,Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was,Swann's Way
7178,"noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know.",Swann's Way
7178,She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her,Swann's Way
7178,"passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to",Swann's Way
7178,"say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,"de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished",Swann's Way
7178,(so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by,Swann's Way
7178,"coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly",Swann's Way
7178,and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she,Swann's Way
7178,"called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see",Swann's Way
7178,that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was,Swann's Way
7178,"not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although",Swann's Way
7178,"such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of",Swann's Way
7178,"that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the",Swann's Way
7178,"most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment,",Swann's Way
7178,even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself,Swann's Way
7178,"whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary",Swann's Way
7178,"concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which,",Swann's Way
7178,"it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had",Swann's Way
7178,ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of,Swann's Way
7178,"her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards",Swann's Way
7178,"the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a",Swann's Way
7178,"compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment",Swann's Way
7178,she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden,Swann's Way
7178,"hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny",Swann's Way
7178,"diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with",Swann's Way
7178,"a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would",Swann's Way
7178,"beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her",Swann's Way
7178,"independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When",Swann's Way
7178,"he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin,",Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile,",Swann's Way
7178,"full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of",Swann's Way
7178,a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her,Swann's Way
7178,"girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures,",Swann's Way
7178,"the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by",Swann's Way
7178,seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of,Swann's Way
7178,"the direction in which they started, the point which one might have",Swann's Way
7178,"expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those",Swann's Way
7178,fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately--with a more,Swann's Way
7178,"premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which,",Swann's Way
7178,"if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish--to",Swann's Way
7178,clutch at one's heart.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors,",Swann's Way
7178,"hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude",Swann's Way
7178,"of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now",Swann's Way
7178,"passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing",Swann's Way
7178,"couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment",Swann's Way
7178,"to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of",Swann's Way
7178,"the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different",Swann's Way
7178,"from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender",Swann's Way
7178,"young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white",Swann's Way
7178,gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed,Swann's Way
7178,"to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the",Swann's Way
7178,"esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its",Swann's Way
7178,"charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in",Swann's Way
7178,it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess.,Swann's Way
7178,Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her,Swann's Way
7178,"young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family,",Swann's Way
7178,"except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having",Swann's Way
7178,"'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially",Swann's Way
7178,"enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him",Swann's Way
7178,"played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian,",Swann's Way
7178,"who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries,",Swann's Way
7178,Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories,Swann's Way
7178,and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though,Swann's Way
7178,"without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen",Swann's Way
7178,"years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg",Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of",Swann's Way
7178,"her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the",Swann's Way
7178,daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead.,Swann's Way
7178,"But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and",Swann's Way
7178,"then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other",Swann's Way
7178,"respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a",Swann's Way
7178,"piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully",Swann's Way
7178,"aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which",Swann's Way
7178,"the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The",Swann's Way
7178,closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her,Swann's Way
7178,"lips. And she murmured ""How charming it is!"" with a stress on the",Swann's Way
7178,"opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which",Swann's Way
7178,"she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a",Swann's Way
7178,"beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into",Swann's Way
7178,"harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental",Swann's Way
7178,gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to,Swann's Way
7178,herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting,Swann's Way
7178,"the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not",Swann's Way
7178,acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room.,Swann's Way
7178,A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once,Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours;",Swann's Way
7178,although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which,Swann's Way
7178,should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on,Swann's Way
7178,"friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any",Swann's Way
7178,"day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not",Swann's Way
7178,"her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,'",Swann's Way
7178,she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some,Swann's Way
7178,non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force,Swann's Way
7178,"the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her",Swann's Way
7178,"cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust",Swann's Way
7178,"out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: ""How is",Swann's Way
7178,"your husband?"" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the",Swann's Way
7178,"Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which",Swann's Way
7178,"was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the",Swann's Way
7178,rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to,Swann's Way
7178,enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated,Swann's Way
7178,"lips and sparkling eyes, answered: ""Why; he's never been better in his",Swann's Way
7178,"life!"" And she went on laughing.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression",Swann's Way
7178,"still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's",Swann's Way
7178,"health, said to her cousin:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oriane,"" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment",Swann's Way
7178,"towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she",Swann's Way
7178,"had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) ""I",Swann's Way
7178,"should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow",Swann's Way

7178,"to have your opinion of it.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking,Swann's Way
7178,"favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just",Swann's Way

7178,"invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the",Swann's Way
7178,country--from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of,Swann's Way

7178,"their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that",Swann's Way
7178,witty 'Guermantes set'--in which there survived something of the,Swann's Way
7178,"alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional",Swann's Way
7178,"sentiments, which dated from Mérimée, and found its final expression in",Swann's Way
7178,the plays of Meilhac and Halévy--she adapted its formula so as to suit,Swann's Way
7178,"even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was",Swann's Way
7178,"always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to",Swann's Way
7178,the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the,Swann's Way

7178,untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it,Swann's Way

7178,followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's,Swann's Way
7178,"fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each",Swann's Way

7178,and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn,Swann's Way
7178,by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her,Swann's Way

7178,favourable on the whole.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?"" asked General de",Swann's Way

7178,"now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one",Swann's Way

7178,"chestnuts, no,--oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess",Swann's Way
7178,have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't,Swann's Way
7178,"tell me, even.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept",Swann's Way
7178,"up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate",Swann's Way
7178,"compliments which most other people would not and need not understand,",Swann's Way
7178,did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had,Swann's Way
7178,"been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of",Swann's Way
7178,"laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set,",Swann's Way
7178,and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself,Swann's Way
7178,without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing.,Swann's Way

7178,"""Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with",Swann's Way

7178,"wish I had!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used",Swann's Way
7178,to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are,Swann's Way

7178,"startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!"" she said with",Swann's Way
7178,a laugh.,Swann's Way

7178,"the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of",Swann's Way
7178,"taste--but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,"" she went on in",Swann's Way
7178,"a coaxing tone, ""I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not",Swann's Way
7178,make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the,Swann's Way
7178,name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only,Swann's Way
7178,"when I see you that I stop feeling bored.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way,Swann's Way
7178,"of looking at the little things of life--the effect, if not the cause of",Swann's Way
7178,which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of,Swann's Way
7178,pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things,Swann's Way
7178,could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the,Swann's Way
7178,trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that,Swann's Way
7178,"enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one",Swann's Way
7178,"found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they",Swann's Way
7178,"had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and",Swann's Way
7178,the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so,Swann's Way
7178,"melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes",Swann's Way
7178,"a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that",Swann's Way
7178,a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard,Swann's Way
7178,"the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much",Swann's Way
7178,comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear",Swann's Way

7178,"spend a most pleasant evening together.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law",Swann's Way
7178,"would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but",Swann's Way

7178,"horror of 'picturesque spots'.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I know it well, it's delightful!"" replied Swann. ""It's almost too",Swann's Way
7178,"beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to",Swann's Way
7178,"be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there",Swann's Way
7178,"speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields",Swann's Way
7178,"begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that",Swann's Way
7178,I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's,Swann's Way

7178,"off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased",Swann's Way
7178,"to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me",Swann's Way

7178,"I never see you at all now!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de",Swann's Way

7178,"which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Poor Swann,"" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; ""he is",Swann's Way

7178,"for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I",Swann's Way
7178,do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should,Swann's Way
7178,"let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even",Swann's Way
7178,"interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!"" she concluded",Swann's Way
7178,"with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such",Swann's Way
7178,persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished,Swann's Way

7178,The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once,Swann's Way
7178,"he felt the need of continuing the conversation. ""Ah!"" he began, ""some",Swann's Way

7178,"explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La Pérouse...""",Swann's Way
7178,"(and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). ""He was",Swann's Way

7178,sadly.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, yes, of course, La Pérouse,"" said the General. ""It's quite a",Swann's Way
7178,"well-known name. There's a street called that.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Do you know anyone in the Rue La Pérouse?"" asked Swann excitedly.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de,Swann's Way
7178,"Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's",Swann's Way
7178,"name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise",Swann's Way
7178,"with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole",Swann's Way
7178,"of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the",Swann's Way
7178,"friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she",Swann's Way
7178,"assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew",Swann's Way
7178,her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her,Swann's Way
7178,"marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which",Swann's Way
7178,was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to,Swann's Way
7178,overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame,Swann's Way
7178,"it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most",Swann's Way
7178,"eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more",Swann's Way
7178,"that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have",Swann's Way

7178,considerable fortune.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,"" said",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not",Swann's Way
7178,now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being,Swann's Way
7178,shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded,Swann's Way
7178,"him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable,",Swann's Way
7178,"had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than",Swann's Way
7178,"smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of",Swann's Way
7178,"insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective",Swann's Way
7178,"state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing",Swann's Way
7178,"external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which",Swann's Way
7178,"even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to",Swann's Way
7178,"prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in",Swann's Way
7178,"which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was",Swann's Way
7178,entirely absent.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore",Swann's Way
7178,him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What,Swann's Way
7178,"had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes,",Swann's Way
7178,"on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which",Swann's Way
7178,"it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation",Swann's Way
7178,"with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a",Swann's Way
7178,"desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before",Swann's Way
7178,"itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its",Swann's Way
7178,"remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a",Swann's Way
7178,door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had,Swann's Way
7178,"had time to understand what was happening, to think: ""It is the little",Swann's Way
7178,"phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!"", all his memories of",Swann's Way
7178,"the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded,",Swann's Way
7178,"up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being,",Swann's Way
7178,"deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they",Swann's Way
7178,"supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken",Swann's Way
7178,"wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his",Swann's Way
7178,"present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In place of the abstract expressions ""the time when I was happy,"" ""the",Swann's Way

7178,"much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything",Swann's Way
7178,of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the,Swann's Way
7178,"reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the",Swann's Way
7178,"peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all;",Swann's Way
7178,"the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed",Swann's Way
7178,"after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the",Swann's Way
7178,"address 'Maison Dorée,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read",Swann's Way
7178,"""My hand trembles so as I write to you,"" the frowning contraction of her",Swann's Way
7178,"eyebrows when she said pleadingly: ""You won't let it be very long before",Swann's Way
7178,"you send for me?""; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he",Swann's Way
7178,used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little,Swann's Way
7178,working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that,Swann's Way
7178,"spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all",Swann's Way
7178,"the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory",Swann's Way
7178,"reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes,",Swann's Way
7178,by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he,Swann's Way
7178,had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures,Swann's Way
7178,of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could,Swann's Way
7178,"stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also;",Swann's Way
7178,how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with,Swann's Way
7178,that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around,Swann's Way
7178,"her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and",Swann's Way
7178,"night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all",Swann's Way
7178,"times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had",Swann's Way
7178,"exclaimed: ""But I can see you at any time; I am always free!""--she, who",Swann's Way
7178,"was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in",Swann's Way
7178,"his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour--of",Swann's Way
7178,"which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious",Swann's Way
7178,waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements--of granting her,Swann's Way
7178,access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let,Swann's Way
7178,"her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to",Swann's Way
7178,"him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be",Swann's Way
7178,"swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of",Swann's Way
7178,"their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when",Swann's Way
7178,"to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that",Swann's Way
7178,"time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself",Swann's Way
7178,"of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need.",Swann's Way
7178,"Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting,",Swann's Way
7178,"as she repeated: ""But why don't you let me come to you oftener?"" he had",Swann's Way
7178,"told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of",Swann's Way
7178,"forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that",Swann's Way
7178,"she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a",Swann's Way
7178,"printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart.",Swann's Way
7178,"""Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone",Swann's Way
7178,"there for? With whom? What happened there?"" He remembered the gas-jets",Swann's Way
7178,that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he,Swann's Way
7178,"had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that",Swann's Way
7178,night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that,Swann's Way
7178,night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would,Swann's Way
7178,"be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he",Swann's Way
7178,that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take,Swann's Way
7178,her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may,Swann's Way
7178,"return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish,",Swann's Way
7178,"standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived",Swann's Way
7178,"again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he",Swann's Way
7178,"did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head,",Swann's Way
7178,lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was,Swann's Way
7178,himself.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that",Swann's Way

7178,"had so often said, without much suffering: ""Perhaps she's in love with",Swann's Way

7178,"And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his",Swann's Way

7178,"doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would",Swann's Way

7178,"darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a",Swann's Way
7178,"devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the",Swann's Way

7178,"as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume",Swann's Way
7178,"of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which",Swann's Way
7178,"he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made",Swann's Way
7178,"involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him,",Swann's Way
7178,"the harmonious, fleeting form.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who",Swann's Way
7178,"addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he",Swann's Way
7178,"had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not",Swann's Way
7178,known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their,Swann's Way
7178,"joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of",Swann's Way
7178,"suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation,",Swann's Way
7178,to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was,Swann's Way
7178,"almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken",Swann's Way
7178,"to him then, which he had seen it--without his being touched by them",Swann's Way
7178,"himself--carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of",Swann's Way
7178,"those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope",Swann's Way
7178,"of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once",Swann's Way
7178,"it had said of his happiness: ""What does all that matter; it is all",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing."" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave",Swann's Way
7178,"of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown,",Swann's Way
7178,exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his,Swann's Way
7178,life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have,Swann's Way
7178,"drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his,Swann's Way
7178,"sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a",Swann's Way
7178,"little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that",Swann's Way
7178,"he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard",Swann's Way
7178,his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the,Swann's Way
7178,"little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short",Swann's Way
7178,"duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as",Swann's Way
7178,"everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but,",Swann's Way
7178,"on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy",Swann's Way
7178,"of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow,",Swann's Way
7178,"'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and",Swann's Way
7178,"even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and",Swann's Way
7178,"in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them,",Swann's Way
7178,"the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it",Swann's Way
7178,"made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by",Swann's Way
7178,all those same onlookers--provided only that they were in any sense,Swann's Way
7178,"musical--who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real",Swann's Way
7178,"life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes.",Swann's Way
7178,Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be,Swann's Way
7178,"analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year",Swann's Way
7178,"before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love",Swann's Way
7178,"of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"had regarded musical _motifs_ as actual ideas, of another world, of",Swann's Way
7178,"another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by",Swann's Way
7178,"the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from",Swann's Way
7178,"another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When,",Swann's Way
7178,"after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little",Swann's Way
7178,"phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his",Swann's Way
7178,"confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress,",Swann's Way
7178,"it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the",Swann's Way
7178,closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and,Swann's Way
7178,to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression,Swann's Way
7178,"of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he",Swann's Way
7178,"was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon",Swann's Way
7178,"certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the",Swann's Way
7178,"mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the",Swann's Way
7178,"Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard",Swann's Way
7178,the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still,Swann's Way
7178,"further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field",Swann's Way
7178,"open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an",Swann's Way
7178,"immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which,",Swann's Way
7178,"here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored",Swann's Way
7178,"tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of",Swann's Way
7178,"passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing",Swann's Way
7178,"from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been",Swann's Way
7178,"discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they",Swann's Way
7178,awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have,Swann's Way
7178,"found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to",Swann's Way
7178,"us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration,",Swann's Way
7178,"of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and",Swann's Way
7178,waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little,Swann's Way
7178,"phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there",Swann's Way
7178,"was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which",Swann's Way
7178,"the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once",Swann's Way
7178,heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of,Swann's Way
7178,their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and,Swann's Way
7178,"happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was",Swann's Way
7178,"peculiar as he would know of the _Princesse de Clèves_, or of _René_,",Swann's Way
7178,should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not,Swann's Way
7178,"thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such",Swann's Way
7178,"as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the",Swann's Way
7178,rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned.,Swann's Way
7178,"Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we",Swann's Way
7178,"return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no",Swann's Way
7178,more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known,Swann's Way
7178,"them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for",Swann's Way
7178,"example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in",Swann's Way
7178,"view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has",Swann's Way
7178,"vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase,",Swann's Way
7178,"like some theme, say, in _Tristan_, which represents to us also a",Swann's Way
7178,"certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had",Swann's Way
7178,endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was,Swann's Way
7178,"linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one",Swann's Way
7178,"of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being",Swann's Way
7178,"that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence;",Swann's Way
7178,"but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these",Swann's Way
7178,"conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either.",Swann's Way
7178,"We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who",Swann's Way
7178,shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something,Swann's Way
7178,"less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata,Swann's Way
7178,"did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it",Swann's Way
7178,"belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we",Swann's Way
7178,"have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim",Swann's Way
7178,with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one,Swann's Way
7178,"forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access",Swann's Way
7178,to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what,Swann's Way
7178,Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer,Swann's Way
7178,had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to,Swann's Way
7178,"draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its",Swann's Way
7178,"outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure,",Swann's Way
7178,"that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a",Swann's Way
7178,"shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some",Swann's Way
7178,more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he,Swann's Way
7178,"believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an",Swann's Way
7178,ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture,Swann's Way
7178,"had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms,",Swann's Way
7178,"sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own",Swann's Way
7178,invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the,Swann's Way
7178,"end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's",Swann's Way
7178,pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable,Swann's Way
7178,"ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and",Swann's Way
7178,"which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory,",Swann's Way
7178,divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened,Swann's Way
7178,to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of,Swann's Way
7178,"the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a",Swann's Way
7178,"syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. ""Audacity,""",Swann's Way
7178,"he exclaimed to himself, ""as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an",Swann's Way
7178,"Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering",Swann's Way
7178,"the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region",Swann's Way
7178,unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he,Swann's Way
7178,"has placed his trust and which he never may discern!"" How charming",Swann's Way
7178,"the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the",Swann's Way
7178,"beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far",Swann's Way
7178,"from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought),",Swann's Way
7178,had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such,Swann's Way
7178,"inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such",Swann's Way
7178,"obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird",Swann's Way
7178,"deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a",Swann's Way
7178,"neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as",Swann's Way
7178,"if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this",Swann's Way
7178,"world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its",Swann's Way
7178,creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world,Swann's Way
7178,"of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of",Swann's Way
7178,"the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose",Swann's Way
7178,plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden,Swann's Way
7178,that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they,Swann's Way
7178,"came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame,",Swann's Way
7178,"to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the",Swann's Way
7178,little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the,Swann's Way
7178,"violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to",Swann's Way
7178,speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that,Swann's Way
7178,the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself,Swann's Way
7178,"face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those",Swann's Way
7178,sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring,Swann's Way
7178,"from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to",Swann's Way
7178,"a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose",Swann's Way
7178,"probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain",Swann's Way
7178,"poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though",Swann's Way
7178,"immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the",Swann's Way
7178,"precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an",Swann's Way
7178,"iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when",Swann's Way
7178,"its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it",Swann's Way
7178,"is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever",Swann's Way
7178,shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to,Swann's Way
7178,"appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and",Swann's Way
7178,"made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all",Swann's Way
7178,"the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest",Swann's Way
7178,"movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious,",Swann's Way
7178,"frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed",Swann's Way
7178,"of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive),",Swann's Way
7178,"breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to",Swann's Way
7178,"arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on",Swann's Way
7178,which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on,Swann's Way
7178,"which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when",Swann's Way
7178,"the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated",Swann's Way
7178,"among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her",Swann's Way
7178,"imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions,",Swann's Way
7178,before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from,Swann's Way
7178,"smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was",Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the",Swann's Way
7178,"virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: ""It's",Swann's Way
7178,"astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it..."" But a scrupulous",Swann's Way
7178,"regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added",Swann's Way
7178,"the reservation: ""anything to beat it... since the table-turning!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had",Swann's Way
7178,"once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would",Swann's Way
7178,"not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had",Swann's Way
7178,"once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him",Swann's Way
7178,"any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of",Swann's Way
7178,a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and,Swann's Way
7178,"sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when",Swann's Way
7178,"they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady,",Swann's Way
7178,"relate, as significant facts of infinite value: ""Yesterday he went",Swann's Way
7178,"through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we",Swann's Way
7178,had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to,Swann's Way
7178,"enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet",Swann's Way
7178,"to-morrow,""--although they themselves know that these things are",Swann's Way
7178,meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was,Swann's Way
7178,assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he,Swann's Way
7178,"would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have",Swann's Way
7178,been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have,Swann's Way
7178,had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon,Swann's Way
7178,"his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to",Swann's Way
7178,"The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of",Swann's Way
7178,Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt,Swann's Way
7178,sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have,Swann's Way
7178,"liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen",Swann's Way
7178,"his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when",Swann's Way
7178,she was not there--for in strange places where our sensations have not,Swann's Way
7178,"been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain--was for him so",Swann's Way
7178,cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it,Swann's Way
7178,incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in,Swann's Way
7178,his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen,Swann's Way
7178,"that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him",Swann's Way
7178,(without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and,Swann's Way
7178,would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a,Swann's Way
7178,year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the,Swann's Way
7178,"platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade",Swann's Way
7178,this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke,Swann's Way
7178,"in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being",Swann's Way
7178,"still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special",Swann's Way
7178,"circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could",Swann's Way
7178,"remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow",Swann's Way
7178,"him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages:",Swann's Way
7178,"his social position--his fortune, from which she stood too often in",Swann's Way
7178,need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture,Swann's Way
7178,"(having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry",Swann's Way
7178,"her)--his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed,",Swann's Way
7178,"had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him",Swann's Way
7178,the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things,Swann's Way
7178,said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an,Swann's Way
7178,"esteem--and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in",Swann's Way
7178,"weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not",Swann's Way
7178,"agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette--he thought of what might",Swann's Way
7178,"have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he",Swann's Way
7178,"thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble,",Swann's Way
7178,"without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to",Swann's Way
7178,"him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged",Swann's Way
7178,"to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so",Swann's Way
7178,"recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: ""People don't",Swann's Way
7178,know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they,Swann's Way
7178,"are."" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for",Swann's Way
7178,"several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should",Swann's Way
7178,"last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his",Swann's Way
7178,"friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a",Swann's Way
7178,"meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he",Swann's Way
7178,"asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances",Swann's Way
7178,that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had,Swann's Way
7178,"not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be",Swann's Way
7178,desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in,Swann's Way
7178,dreams--his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not,Swann's Way
7178,"know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they",Swann's Way
7178,supposed.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she",Swann's Way
7178,"who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares,",Swann's Way
7178,"from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he",Swann's Way
7178,"marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which",Swann's Way
7178,"was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that",Swann's Way
7178,"environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret",Swann's Way
7178,"desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the",Swann's Way
7178,"soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its",Swann's Way
7178,"career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very",Swann's Way
7178,cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he,Swann's Way
7178,"admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of",Swann's Way
7178,"his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly",Swann's Way
7178,"relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed",Swann's Way
7178,"of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to",Swann's Way
7178,deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's,Swann's Way
7178,very life.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent,Swann's Way
7178,"return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations",Swann's Way
7178,"his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave",Swann's Way
7178,Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her,Swann's Way
7178,"one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had",Swann's Way
7178,"abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it",Swann's Way
7178,the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in,Swann's Way
7178,"him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the",Swann's Way
7178,"days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency",Swann's Way
7178,"in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him",Swann's Way
7178,"any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing",Swann's Way
7178,"stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed",Swann's Way
7178,"to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice",Swann's Way
7178,"immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and",Swann's Way
7178,Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass,Swann's Way
7178,which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain,Swann's Way
7178,"to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a",Swann's Way
7178,"malicious smile: ""Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide.",Swann's Way
7178,"He's going to Egypt!"" and Swann had at once understood that this meant:",Swann's Way
7178,"""I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville."" And, in fact,",Swann's Way
7178,"if, a few days later, Swann began: ""About that trip that you told me you",Swann's Way
7178,"were going to take with Forcheville,"" she would answer carelessly: ""Yes,",Swann's Way
7178,"my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the",Swann's Way
7178,"Pyramids."" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's",Swann's Way
7178,"mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He",Swann's Way
7178,"knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she",Swann's Way
7178,"would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained",Swann's Way
7178,"his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making",Swann's Way
7178,"himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of",Swann's Way
7178,ever being loved by her.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had,Swann's Way
7178,"been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among",Swann's Way
7178,"them Forcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she",Swann's Way
7178,frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that,Swann's Way
7178,there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of,Swann's Way
7178,sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a,Swann's Way
7178,familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he,Swann's Way
7178,had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other,Swann's Way
7178,"people, those which had no visible connection with what they said.",Swann's Way
7178,And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent,Swann's Way
7178,"character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that",Swann's Way
7178,he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might,Swann's Way
7178,"have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation",Swann's Way
7178,"with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as",Swann's Way
7178,everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly,Swann's Way
7178,"disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with",Swann's Way
7178,the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus,Swann's Way
7178,"was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and",Swann's Way
7178,"kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for",Swann's Way
7178,"M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing",Swann's Way
7178,"circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would",Swann's Way
7178,act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable,Swann's Way
7178,to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M.,Swann's Way
7178,"d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever",Swann's Way
7178,he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one,Swann's Way
7178,"side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine",Swann's Way
7178,sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was,Swann's Way
7178,"becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover",Swann's Way
7178,a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other,Swann's Way
7178,"reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he",Swann's Way
7178,"was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus",Swann's Way
7178,"might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a",Swann's Way
7178,"neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away",Swann's Way
7178,"by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury.",Swann's Way
7178,"Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes",Swann's Way
7178,"was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But",Swann's Way
7178,for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to,Swann's Way
7178,"him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold,",Swann's Way
7178,was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted,Swann's Way
7178,that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people.,Swann's Way
7178,Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their,Swann's Way
7178,"neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort,",Swann's Way
7178,"answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was,",Swann's Way
7178,"so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of",Swann's Way
7178,causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But,Swann's Way
7178,"with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the",Swann's Way
7178,"Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might",Swann's Way
7178,be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was,Swann's Way
7178,"everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking",Swann's Way
7178,"in that either, and his relations with Swann--cordial, but scarcely",Swann's Way
7178,"intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views",Swann's Way
7178,"about everything, they found in talking together--were more quiescent",Swann's Way
7178,"than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be",Swann's Way
7178,"led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by",Swann's Way
7178,"whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy)",Swann's Way
7178,"loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be",Swann's Way
7178,called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice,Swann's Way
7178,"of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had",Swann's Way
7178,"never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was",Swann's Way
7178,"in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. ""It is not for nothing,"" he now",Swann's Way
7178,"assured himself, ""that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour,",Swann's Way
7178,their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are,Swann's Way
7178,"significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and",Swann's Way
7178,"des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour.",Swann's Way
7178,"Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour.",Swann's Way
7178,"He may have acted dishonourably once again."" Then he suspected Rémi,",Swann's Way
7178,"who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt",Swann's Way
7178,"himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan",Swann's Way
7178,"had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we",Swann's Way
7178,"not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our",Swann's Way
7178,"own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and",Swann's Way
7178,"vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find",Swann's Way
7178,themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own,Swann's Way
7178,class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined?",Swann's Way
7178,"Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have",Swann's Way
7178,"thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn,",Swann's Way
7178,"Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire",Swann's Way
7178,"once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the",Swann's Way
7178,"artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even",Swann's Way
7178,"openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of",Swann's Way
7178,"honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them",Swann's Way
7178,"with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which",Swann's Way
7178,"the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of",Swann's Way
7178,"their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this",Swann's Way
7178,anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of,Swann's Way
7178,"the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy",Swann's Way
7178,should lurk in the depths--which no strange eye might explore--of,Swann's Way
7178,"the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the",Swann's Way
7178,"business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion",Swann's Way
7178,"ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there",Swann's Way
7178,"was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in",Swann's Way
7178,"certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then",Swann's Way
7178,cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two,Swann's Way
7178,"or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief,",Swann's Way
7178,"and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself",Swann's Way
7178,"frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and",Swann's Way
7178,"the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were",Swann's Way
7178,"incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human",Swann's Way
7178,"life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people",Swann's Way
7178,"who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to",Swann's Way
7178,"shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely",Swann's Way
7178,"formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to",Swann's Way
7178,"drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they",Swann's Way
7178,did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated,Swann's Way
7178,against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other,Swann's Way
7178,"men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew",Swann's Way
7178,"quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but",Swann's Way
7178,in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or,Swann's Way
7178,her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the,Swann's Way
7178,part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the,Swann's Way
7178,"light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or",Swann's Way
7178,"an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would",Swann's Way
7178,ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles,Swann's Way
7178,"which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which",Swann's Way
7178,"he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers,",Swann's Way
7178,"would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended",Swann's Way
7178,"those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those",Swann's Way
7178,actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and,Swann's Way
7178,"she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather",Swann's Way
7178,"as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some",Swann's Way
7178,"other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have",Swann's Way
7178,"struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses,",Swann's Way
7178,"that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led",Swann's Way
7178,"the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of",Swann's Way
7178,"mortals--would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation",Swann's Way
7178,"of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the",Swann's Way
7178,"daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor",Swann's Way
7178,"place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people",Swann's Way
7178,maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making,Swann's Way
7178,opportune use of some detail--insignificant but true--which he had,Swann's Way
7178,"accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would",Swann's Way
7178,"allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless",Swann's Way
7178,other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which,Swann's Way
7178,"he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was",Swann's Way
7178,"perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor",Swann's Way
7178,"suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make",Swann's Way
7178,"alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in",Swann's Way
7178,"order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as",Swann's Way
7178,"he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might",Swann's Way
7178,love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his,Swann's Way
7178,"mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had",Swann's Way
7178,not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which,Swann's Way
7178,"Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth",Swann's Way
7178,"from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very",Swann's Way
7178,falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every,Swann's Way
7178,"human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much",Swann's Way
7178,"as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less",Swann's Way
7178,"egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the",Swann's Way
7178,"things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust",Swann's Way
7178,"and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be",Swann's Way
7178,"humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the",Swann's Way
7178,longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist,Swann's Way
7178,"without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an",Swann's Way
7178,invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des,Swann's Way
7178,Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being,Swann's Way
7178,"played, the sight of the title--_Les Filles de Marbre_, by Théodore",Swann's Way
7178,"Barrière,--struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively",Swann's Way
7178,"from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of",Swann's Way
7178,"footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word",Swann's Way
7178,"'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it",Swann's Way
7178,"passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once",Swann's Way
7178,"again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at",Swann's Way
7178,"the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, ""Take",Swann's Way
7178,"care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of",Swann's Way
7178,"marble."" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had",Swann's Way
7178,not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more,Swann's Way
7178,confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter,Swann's Way
7178,referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift,Swann's Way
7178,"his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to",Swann's Way
7178,"see again the words, _Filles de Marbre_, and began to read mechanically",Swann's Way
7178,"the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel,",Swann's Way
7178,"and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he",Swann's Way
7178,recoiled again in horror.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the,Swann's Way
7178,"same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen,",Swann's Way
7178,"a second name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but",Swann's Way
7178,without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that,Swann's Way
7178,"borne by his friend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of",Swann's Way
7178,"having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Bréauté,",Swann's Way
7178,there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin,Swann's Way
7178,"was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never,",Swann's Way
7178,"by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations",Swann's Way
7178,"with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could",Swann's Way
7178,"recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their",Swann's Way
7178,"inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby",Swann's Way
7178,"certifying their own innocence), who--as, for instance, Odette,--would",Swann's Way
7178,be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one,Swann's Way
7178,"another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she",Swann's Way
7178,had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into,Swann's Way
7178,"being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything",Swann's Way
7178,"that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at",Swann's Way
7178,"that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration",Swann's Way
7178,"which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but",Swann's Way
7178,"an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural",Swann's Way
7178,"law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the",Swann's Way
7178,"first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years",Swann's Way
7178,"before: ""Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me.",Swann's Way
7178,"I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with",Swann's Way
7178,"her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name."" So far from seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations,",Swann's Way
7178,"intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since",Swann's Way
7178,"repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's",Swann's Way
7178,warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her,Swann's Way
7178,affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory,Swann's Way
7178,of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his,Swann's Way
7178,"mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a",Swann's Way
7178,"certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return,",Swann's Way
7178,spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat,Swann's Way
7178,"down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her,",Swann's Way
7178,"not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger",Swann's Way
7178,"that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love",Swann's Way
7178,expire. Suddenly he made up his mind.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Odette, my darling,"" he began, ""I know, I am being simply odious, but I",Swann's Way
7178,must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you,Swann's Way
7178,"and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone",Swann's Way
7178,"else, ever?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people",Swann's Way
7178,"commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would",Swann's Way
7178,"bore them to go, when some one has asked, ""Are you coming to watch the",Swann's Way
7178,"procession go by?"", or ""Will you be at the review?"". But this shake of",Swann's Way
7178,"the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in",Swann's Way
7178,"an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of",Swann's Way
7178,uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past.,Swann's Way
7178,"Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than",Swann's Way
7178,"any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it",Swann's Way
7178,was quite possibly true.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,"" she added, seeming",Swann's Way
7178,angry and uncomfortable.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You",Swann's Way
7178,"know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any",Swann's Way
7178,"woman.'""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she",Swann's Way
7178,"hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: ""I have never done anything of that",Swann's Way
7178,"sort with any woman.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have,Swann's Way
7178,"made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you!",Swann's Way
7178,"Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice",Swann's Way

7178,"untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in",Swann's Way

7178,"times.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must,",Swann's Way
7178,"therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities,",Swann's Way
7178,any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual,Swann's Way
7178,"movement of the clouds overhead, since those words ""two or three times""",Swann's Way
7178,"carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A",Swann's Way
7178,"strange thing, indeed, that those words, ""two or three times,"" nothing",Swann's Way
7178,"more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so",Swann's Way
7178,"lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken",Swann's Way
7178,"a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of",Swann's Way
7178,"the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: ""I have never",Swann's Way
7178,"seen anything to beat it since the table-turning."" The agony that he now",Swann's Way
7178,"suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in",Swann's Way
7178,"the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined",Swann's Way
7178,"such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that",Swann's Way
7178,"offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular",Swann's Way
7178,"horror which had escaped with the words ""perhaps two or three times,""",Swann's Way
7178,"was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything",Swann's Way
7178,that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first,Swann's Way
7178,"time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less",Swann's Way
7178,"dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion",Swann's Way
7178,"as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price",Swann's Way
7178,"of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He",Swann's Way
7178,"wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which",Swann's Way
7178,"one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that",Swann's Way
7178,"the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done ""two or three",Swann's Way
7178,"times"" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must",Swann's Way
7178,"watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the",Swann's Way
7178,"faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment",Swann's Way
7178,"to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he",Swann's Way
7178,"does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He",Swann's Way
7178,might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any,Swann's Way
7178,"one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how",Swann's Way
7178,insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when,Swann's Way
7178,he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the,Swann's Way
7178,possession--as if that were ever possible--of another person. Happily,Swann's Way
7178,"for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like",Swann's Way
7178,"a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older,",Swann's Way
7178,"more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ",Swann's Way
7178,"which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles",Swann's Way
7178,of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These,Swann's Way
7178,"older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,"strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives",Swann's Way
7178,"one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an",Swann's Way
7178,operation. This time it was not so much--as it ordinarily was--in,Swann's Way
7178,Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took,Swann's Way
7178,"effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have",Swann's Way
7178,"once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more",Swann's Way
7178,"stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its",Swann's Way
7178,own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit,Swann's Way
7178,"evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to",Swann's Way
7178,"the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the",Swann's Way
7178,"emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such",Swann's Way
7178,emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more,Swann's Way
7178,"than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart,",Swann's Way
7178,"to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble",Swann's Way
7178,his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his,Swann's Way
7178,"jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would",Swann's Way
7178,"have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly",Swann's Way
7178,"acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy",Swann's Way
7178,"was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose",Swann's Way
7178,"his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was",Swann's Way
7178,"inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not",Swann's Way
7178,"his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more",Swann's Way
7178,severe.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""My darling,"" he began again, ""it's all over now; was it with anyone I",Swann's Way
7178,"know?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really",Swann's Way

7178,"matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were",Swann's Way
7178,able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking,Swann's Way
7178,"of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't",Swann's Way
7178,bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a,Swann's Way
7178,clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what,Swann's Way
7178,one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire,Swann's Way
7178,"you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have",Swann's Way

7178,positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd,Swann's Way
7178,"be a lot better off!"" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with",Swann's Way
7178,intentional malice.,Swann's Way

7178,"""I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only",Swann's Way

7178,"whom, Odette, my love.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one",Swann's Way
7178,evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with,Swann's Way
7178,"the Princesse des Laumes,"" she added, happy to be able to furnish him",Swann's Way
7178,"with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. ""At the next",Swann's Way
7178,table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to,Swann's Way
7178,"me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight",Swann's Way
7178,"on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired,",Swann's Way
7178,"and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been",Swann's Way
7178,"anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,'",Swann's Way
7178,"I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after."" Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it",Swann's Way
7178,"appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was",Swann's Way
7178,"thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed.",Swann's Way
7178,"But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You are a fiend!"" she flung at him, ""you enjoy tormenting me, making me",Swann's Way
7178,"tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the,Swann's Way
7178,"first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden",Swann's Way
7178,"from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered,",Swann's Way
7178,"which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself",Swann's Way
7178,"to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now",Swann's Way
7178,"assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty.",Swann's Way
7178,"In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on",Swann's Way
7178,"the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette",Swann's Way
7178,"had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the",Swann's Way
7178,"little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for",Swann's Way
7178,"breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the ""rock there,""... He",Swann's Way
7178,"could hear her answer--alas, how lightheartedly--""I've heard that tale",Swann's Way
7178,"before!"" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that",Swann's Way
7178,no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent,Swann's Way
7178,"for a time, then said to her:",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you",Swann's Way
7178,"dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not,Swann's Way
7178,"know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his",Swann's Way
7178,"memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the",Swann's Way
7178,"news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he",Swann's Way
7178,was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired,Swann's Way
7178,the habit of finding life interesting--of marvelling at the strange,Swann's Way
7178,discoveries that there were to be made in it--that even while he was,Swann's Way
7178,suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such,Swann's Way
7178,"agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: ""Life is indeed",Swann's Way
7178,"astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far",Swann's Way
7178,more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom,Swann's Way
7178,"I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any",Swann's Way
7178,"case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal",Swann's Way
7178,and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable,Swann's Way
7178,"accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far",Swann's Way
7178,"more than I could ever have suspected."" But he could not confine himself",Swann's Way
7178,to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of,Swann's Way
7178,"the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he",Swann's Way
7178,"might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to",Swann's Way
7178,"do them again. He repeated her words to himself: ""I knew quite well what",Swann's Way
7178,"she was after."" ""Two or three times."" ""I've heard that tale before."" But",Swann's Way
7178,they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife,Swann's Way
7178,"with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man",Swann's Way
7178,"who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the",Swann's Way
7178,"movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself:",Swann's Way
7178,"""I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,"" ""I've heard that tale before,""",Swann's Way
7178,but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed,Swann's Way
7178,"to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly,",Swann's Way
7178,"had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to",Swann's Way
7178,him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number,Swann's Way
7178,"of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to",Swann's Way
7178,"expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to",Swann's Way
7178,"remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always",Swann's Way
7178,guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile:,Swann's Way
7178,"""You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!""",Swann's Way
7178,"By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures)",Swann's Way
7178,been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not,Swann's Way
7178,see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She,Swann's Way
7178,was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother,Swann's Way
7178,"who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice,",Swann's Way
7178,to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained,Swann's Way
7178,for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's _Journal d'un Poète_ which,Swann's Way
7178,"he had previously read without emotion: ""When one feels oneself smitten",Swann's Way
7178,"by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her",Swann's Way
7178,surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies,Swann's Way
7178,"in the answer."" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt",Swann's Way
7178,"over in his mind as, ""I've heard that tale before,"" or ""I knew quite",Swann's Way
7178,"well what she was after,"" could cause him so much pain. But he realised",Swann's Way
7178,that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the,Swann's Way
7178,panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt,Swann's Way
7178,while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he,Swann's Way
7178,"now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,--indeed, it",Swann's Way
7178,"was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether",Swann's Way
7178,forgiven the offence--whenever he repeated her words his old anguish,Swann's Way
7178,"refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant,",Swann's Way
7178,"trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might",Swann's Way
7178,"be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man",Swann's Way
7178,who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story,Swann's Way
7178,"would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled",Swann's Way
7178,at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the,Swann's Way
7178,"weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age",Swann's Way
7178,"creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments.",Swann's Way
7178,"But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one",Swann's Way
7178,"of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a",Swann's Way
7178,"new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with",Swann's Way
7178,undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with,Swann's Way
7178,"the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than",Swann's Way
7178,"the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it,",Swann's Way
7178,overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever,Swann's Way
7178,"point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that",Swann's Way
7178,"season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the",Swann's Way
7178,"Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by",Swann's Way
7178,slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him,Swann's Way
7178,was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be,Swann's Way
7178,inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all,Swann's Way
7178,"the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him,",Swann's Way
7178,"a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind,",Swann's Way
7178,"was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had",Swann's Way
7178,"consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete",Swann's Way
7178,"incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past,",Swann's Way
7178,"now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an",Swann's Way
7178,"obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued",Swann's Way
7178,"to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from",Swann's Way
7178,"laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day,",Swann's Way
7178,"he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des",Swann's Way
7178,Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain;,Swann's Way
7178,meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him,Swann's Way
7178,"with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of",Swann's Way
7178,"different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed,",Swann's Way
7178,would make it break out again in another form.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded,",Swann's Way
7178,"now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without",Swann's Way
7178,"thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her",Swann's Way
7178,vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life,Swann's Way
7178,"which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead,",Swann's Way
7178,"was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same",Swann's Way
7178,air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any,Swann's Way
7178,"suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which",Swann's Way
7178,he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being,Swann's Way
7178,imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal,Swann's Way
7178,"ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind,",Swann's Way
7178,"with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann,",Swann's Way
7178,"her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected",Swann's Way
7178,"by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them,",Swann's Way
7178,without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself,Swann's Way
7178,"in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was",Swann's Way
7178,overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed.,Swann's Way
7178,"One day, he was trying--without hurting Odette--to discover from her",Swann's Way
7178,"whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a",Swann's Way
7178,"matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had",Swann's Way
7178,"put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been",Swann's Way
7178,"received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained",Swann's Way
7178,"there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden--a dead weight, but",Swann's Way
7178,"none the less disturbing--of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now",Swann's Way
7178,extirpate it for ever.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,""",Swann's Way
7178,her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it,Swann's Way

7178,"waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any",Swann's Way
7178,"money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll",Swann's Way
7178,kill myself if you don't bring her to me'--meaning me! They told her I'd,Swann's Way
7178,"gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself",Swann's Way
7178,"and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen",Swann's Way
7178,"the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told",Swann's Way
7178,me I shouted fit to bring the house down:--'But when you hear me say,Swann's Way
7178,"that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all!",Swann's Way
7178,I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and,Swann's Way
7178,"where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter",Swann's Way
7178,has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of,Swann's Way

7178,"while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear.",Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Besides, her very admissions--when she made any--of faults which she",Swann's Way
7178,"supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point",Swann's Way
7178,for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions,Swann's Way
7178,never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate,Swann's Way
7178,"her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the",Swann's Way
7178,"accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed",Swann's Way
7178,"him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his",Swann's Way
7178,jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried,Swann's Way
7178,"them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like",Swann's Way
7178,corpses in a river. And they poisoned it.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the,Swann's Way
7178,"day of the Paris-Murcie Fête. ""What! you knew him as long ago as that?",Swann's Way
7178,"Oh, yes, of course you did,"" he corrected himself, so as not to shew",Swann's Way
7178,that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble,Swann's Way
7178,"at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had",Swann's Way
7178,"received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been",Swann's Way
7178,"having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore",Swann's Way
7178,"that she had not. ""Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or",Swann's Way
7178,"other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,"" he pursued, hoping to",Swann's Way
7178,"frighten her. ""Yes, that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I",Swann's Way
7178,"told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me",Swann's Way
7178,"at Prévost's,"" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a",Swann's Way
7178,"firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a",Swann's Way
7178,"fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to",Swann's Way
7178,"conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if",Swann's Way
7178,she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a,Swann's Way
7178,"headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty,",Swann's Way
7178,"since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh,",Swann's Way
7178,"though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from",Swann's Way
7178,"thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. ""It's quite true, I",Swann's Way
7178,hadn't been to the Maison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I,Swann's Way
7178,"had, really, been to Prévost's--that wasn't a story--and he met me there",Swann's Way
7178,and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came,Swann's Way
7178,to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I,Swann's Way
7178,"was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really,",Swann's Way
7178,"don't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all",Swann's Way
7178,"about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight,",Swann's Way
7178,"that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, if it were",Swann's Way
7178,true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so,Swann's Way
7178,"well as we do now, did we, dear?""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly",Swann's Way
7178,"spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so,",Swann's Way
7178,"even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because",Swann's Way
7178,"they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was",Swann's Way
7178,already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which,Swann's Way
7178,"they had ""done a cattleya"") when she had told him that she was coming",Swann's Way
7178,"from the Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each",Swann's Way
7178,of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He,Swann's Way
7178,"recalled how she had said to him once: ""I need only tell Mme. Verdurin",Swann's Way
7178,"that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always",Swann's Way
7178,"some excuse."" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly",Swann's Way
7178,uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the,Swann's Way
7178,"hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his",Swann's Way
7178,"having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had",Swann's Way
7178,"had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: ""I need only",Swann's Way
7178,"tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There",Swann's Way
7178,"is always some excuse."" And beneath all his most pleasant memories,",Swann's Way
7178,beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those,Swann's Way
7178,"old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of",Swann's Way
7178,"a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him,",Swann's Way
7178,"beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du",Swann's Way
7178,"Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that",Swann's Way
7178,"temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day",Swann's Way
7178,"has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding",Swann's Way
7178,"place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of",Swann's Way
7178,a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that,Swann's Way
7178,"had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La Pérouse",Swann's Way
7178,"itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours",Swann's Way
7178,than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror,Swann's Way
7178,that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to,Swann's Way
7178,"the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of",Swann's Way
7178,"Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past....",Swann's Way
7178,"If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of",Swann's Way
7178,"the Maison Dorée it was because that name recalled to him, no longer,",Swann's Way
7178,"as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good",Swann's Way
7178,"fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now",Swann's Way
7178,"first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dorée, as it had befallen the",Swann's Way
7178,"Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him.",Swann's Way
7178,"For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them,",Swann's Way
7178,"single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an",Swann's Way
7178,"infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is",Swann's Way
7178,"ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the",Swann's Way
7178,"impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's",Swann's Way
7178,"love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of",Swann's Way
7178,"infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which",Swann's Way
7178,had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time,Swann's Way
7178,"without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by",Swann's Way
7178,others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart,Swann's Way
7178,alternate seeds of love and suspicion.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of,Swann's Way
7178,"which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage,",Swann's Way
7178,under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must,Swann's Way
7178,"instantly accompany her home, to ""do a cattleya,"" and the desire",Swann's Way
7178,"which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so",Swann's Way
7178,"imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative",Swann's Way
7178,"and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann",Swann's Way
7178,just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had,Swann's Way
7178,"thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was",Swann's Way
7178,"interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to",Swann's Way
7178,"her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he",Swann's Way
7178,"rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage",Swann's Way
7178,"to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering",Swann's Way
7178,"rage, broke a vase, with ""I never can do anything right with you,",Swann's Way
7178,"you impossible person!"" And he was left uncertain whether she had not",Swann's Way
7178,"actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had",Swann's Way
7178,"wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, although he dared not mention her name. ""I have a little thing",Swann's Way
7178,"here, you're sure to like,"" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he",Swann's Way
7178,"would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who",Swann's Way
7178,"sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still",Swann's Way
7178,"quite young and attractive, said to him once, ""Of course, what I should",Swann's Way
7178,"like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain,",Swann's Way
7178,"I should never go with any other men again."" ""Indeed, do you think it",Swann's Way
7178,possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with,Swann's Way
7178,"her, and never to be unfaithful to him?"" asked Swann anxiously. ""Why,",Swann's Way
7178,"surely! It all depends on their characters!"" Swann could not help making",Swann's Way
7178,the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse,Swann's Way
7178,"des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a",Swann's Way
7178,"smile: ""But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with",Swann's Way
7178,"your sash."" ""And you too, you've got blue cuffs on."" ""What a charming",Swann's Way
7178,"conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring",Swann's Way
7178,"you, am I; or keeping you?"" ""No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you",Swann's Way
7178,"bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk."" ""I am highly",Swann's Way
7178,"flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?"" he asked the 'manageress,'",Swann's Way
7178,"who had just looked in. ""Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come",Swann's Way
7178,"to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other",Swann's Way
7178,"day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems",Swann's Way
7178,"that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal,",Swann's Way
7178,"I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,""",Swann's Way
7178,"she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue",Swann's Way
7178,eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to,Swann's Way
7178,interest him. She did not know Odette.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage;",Swann's Way
7178,several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins,Swann's Way
7178,"could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of",Swann's Way
7178,"all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly",Swann's Way
7178,"going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time,",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but,",Swann's Way
7178,as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical,Swann's Way
7178,"distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to",Swann's Way
7178,"Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone",Swann's Way
7178,"away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a",Swann's Way
7178,"series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged",Swann's Way
7178,"everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to",Swann's Way
7178,"the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted",Swann's Way
7178,"to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had",Swann's Way
7178,"been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and",Swann's Way
7178,almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the,Swann's Way
7178,pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no,Swann's Way
7178,"need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,"Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a",Swann's Way
7178,"revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their",Swann's Way
7178,liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One,Swann's Way
7178,"day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some",Swann's Way
7178,"business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting",Swann's Way
7178,"opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose",Swann's Way
7178,"'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk",Swann's Way
7178,"dress, a muff, an umbrella (which would do for a parasol if the rain",Swann's Way
7178,"kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the",Swann's Way
7178,"cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go",Swann's Way
7178,"on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when",Swann's Way
7178,"she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a",Swann's Way
7178,"transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the",Swann's Way
7178,natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the,Swann's Way
7178,"doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention",Swann's Way
7178,"the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow",Swann's Way
7178,"and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was",Swann's Way
7178,"completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from",Swann's Way
7178,those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of,Swann's Way

7178,"atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with",Swann's Way
7178,the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself,Swann's Way
7178,"overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and",Swann's Way
7178,"almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was",Swann's Way
7178,"no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now,",Swann's Way
7178,"as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with",Swann's Way

7178,"her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she",Swann's Way

7178,"for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever",Swann's Way
7178,"her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal,",Swann's Way
7178,"feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women",Swann's Way
7178,"could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final",Swann's Way
7178,"transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed",Swann's Way
7178,"affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the",Swann's Way
7178,"painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom",Swann's Way
7178,Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come",Swann's Way
7178,"when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to",Swann's Way
7178,"keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to",Swann's Way
7178,"escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the",Swann's Way
7178,faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in,Swann's Way
7178,"his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say",Swann's Way
7178,"become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the",Swann's Way
7178,"self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught",Swann's Way
7178,"his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and,",Swann's Way
7178,inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from,Swann's Way
7178,that period in which he had so keenly suffered--though in it he had also,Swann's Way
7178,known a way of feeling so intensely happy--and that the accidents of his,Swann's Way
7178,"course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily",Swann's Way
7178,"and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything,",Swann's Way
7178,"an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice",Swann's Way
7178,"behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that",Swann's Way
7178,"Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this",Swann's Way
7178,"particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made",Swann's Way
7178,"an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he",Swann's Way
7178,"might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was",Swann's Way
7178,"too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be",Swann's Way
7178,"a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had",Swann's Way
7178,"departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete",Swann's Way
7178,duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling,Swann's Way
7178,"which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering",Swann's Way
7178,"in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would",Swann's Way
7178,take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that,Swann's Way
7178,"he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough",Swann's Way
7178,"later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity,",Swann's Way
7178,with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over,Swann's Way
7178,his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing,Swann's Way
7178,"him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has",Swann's Way
7178,"lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip",Swann's Way
7178,"away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed,",Swann's Way
7178,"like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the",Swann's Way
7178,"frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close",Swann's Way
7178,"at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's",Swann's Way
7178,"lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now",Swann's Way
7178,"utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the",Swann's Way
7178,"moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before",Swann's Way
7178,"kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his",Swann's Way
7178,"memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was",Swann's Way
7178,"altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have",Swann's Way
7178,"wished--in thought at least--to have been in a position to bid farewell,",Swann's Way
7178,"while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and",Swann's Way
7178,"jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now",Swann's Way
7178,he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see,Swann's Way
7178,"her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard,",Swann's Way
7178,"a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette,",Swann's Way
7178,"Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line",Swann's Way
7178,"of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few",Swann's Way
7178,"feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the",Swann's Way
7178,party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those,Swann's Way
7178,"who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing,",Swann's Way
7178,and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them.,Swann's Way
7178,"Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on",Swann's Way
7178,"his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off,",Swann's Way
7178,"but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well",Swann's Way
7178,"as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness,",Swann's Way
7178,"this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished",Swann's Way
7178,"gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change",Swann's Way
7178,"its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy",Swann's Way
7178,"moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with",Swann's Way
7178,"little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she",Swann's Way
7178,"looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he",Swann's Way
7178,loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him,Swann's Way
7178,"at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch,",Swann's Way
7178,"and said: ""I must go."" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal",Swann's Way
7178,"manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were",Swann's Way
7178,"to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked",Swann's Way
7178,"to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction,",Swann's Way
7178,to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was,Swann's Way
7178,"frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly",Swann's Way
7178,"have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly,",Swann's Way
7178,have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb,Swann's Way
7178,"with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from",Swann's Way
7178,"Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second",Swann's Way
7178,passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter,Swann's Way
7178,remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately,Swann's Way
7178,"after Odette. ""They had obviously arranged it between them,"" he added;",Swann's Way
7178,"""they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they",Swann's Way
7178,wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his,Swann's Way
7178,"mistress."" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to",Swann's Way
7178,"console him. ""After all, she is quite right,"" he said to the young man,",Swann's Way
7178,drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more,Swann's Way
7178,"at ease. ""I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be",Swann's Way
7178,"so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."" So Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at",Swann's Way
7178,"first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had",Swann's Way
7178,"distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the",Swann's Way
7178,"'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped",Swann's Way
7178,with a fez.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association",Swann's Way
7178,"of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy,",Swann's Way
7178,"and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast,",Swann's Way
7178,"had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the",Swann's Way
7178,"person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images,",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time,",Swann's Way
7178,such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple,Swann's Way
7178,"act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he",Swann's Way
7178,felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he,Swann's Way
7178,"thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of",Swann's Way
7178,"which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes",Swann's Way
7178,"which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite",Swann's Way
7178,"points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to",Swann's Way
7178,startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum,Swann's Way
7178,"rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses;",Swann's Way
7178,"he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own",Swann's Way
7178,"heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast.",Swann's Way
7178,"Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a",Swann's Way
7178,"nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at",Swann's Way
7178,"him as he passed: ""Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night",Swann's Way
7178,"with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him",Swann's Way
7178,"everything. It was they that started the fire."" It was his valet, come",Swann's Way
7178,"to awaken him, and saying:--",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to",Swann's Way
7178,"call again in an hour.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing",Swann's Way
7178,"that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of",Swann's Way
7178,"water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of",Swann's Way
7178,"the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the",Swann's Way
7178,"clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile",Swann's Way
7178,"the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,"heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very",Swann's Way
7178,distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the,Swann's Way
7178,"sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose,",Swann's Way
7178,and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had,Swann's Way
7178,"written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going,",Swann's Way
7178,"that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer--Mlle.",Swann's Way
7178,Legrandin that had been--was spending a few days there. The association,Swann's Way
7178,in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country,Swann's Way
7178,"which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction",Swann's Way
7178,which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the,Swann's Way
7178,different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain,Swann's Way
7178,other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we,Swann's Way
7178,"are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before",Swann's Way
7178,"love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest",Swann's Way
7178,"appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as",Swann's Way
7178,"an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann",Swann's Way
7178,"had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in",Swann's Way
7178,"the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever",Swann's Way
7178,seeing her again--and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de,Swann's Way
7178,"Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Froberville to",Swann's Way
7178,Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is,Swann's Way
7178,"not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness",Swann's Way
7178,which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations,Swann's Way
7178,"of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might",Swann's Way
7178,"have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who,",Swann's Way
7178,"indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening,",Swann's Way
7178,"somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to",Swann's Way
7178,"him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what",Swann's Way
7178,"did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place,",Swann's Way
7178,and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact,Swann's Way
7178,that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that,Swann's Way
7178,"evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention",Swann's Way
7178,"that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any",Swann's Way
7178,"length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be",Swann's Way
7178,"wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he",Swann's Way
7178,"had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected,",Swann's Way
7178,"which were already being brought to birth,--the exact balance between",Swann's Way
7178,which was too difficult to establish--were linked by a sort of,Swann's Way
7178,concatenation of necessity.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions",Swann's Way
7178,"to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become",Swann's Way
7178,"disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he",Swann's Way
7178,"saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid",Swann's Way
7178,"complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all",Swann's Way
7178,the things which--in the course of those successive bursts of affection,Swann's Way
7178,which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the,Swann's Way
7178,first impression that he had formed of her--he had ceased to observe,Swann's Way
7178,"after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless,",Swann's Way
7178,"while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of",Swann's Way
7178,"those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared",Swann's Way
7178,"in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time,",Swann's Way
7178,"the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: ""To think",Swann's Way
7178,"that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that",Swann's Way
7178,the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did,Swann's Way

7178,,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,Among the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during,Swann's Way
7178,"my long nights of sleeplessness, there was none that differed more",Swann's Way
7178,"utterly from the rooms at Combray, thickly powdered with the motes of an",Swann's Way
7178,"atmosphere granular, pollenous, edible and instinct with piety, than",Swann's Way
7178,"my room in the Grand Hôtel de la Plage, at Balbec, the walls of which,",Swann's Way
7178,"washed with ripolin, contained, like the polished sides of a basin in",Swann's Way
7178,"which the water glows with a blue, lurking fire, a finer air, pure,",Swann's Way
7178,"azure-tinted, saline. The Bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted",Swann's Way
7178,with the furnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration,Swann's Way
7178,"in different rooms, and in that which I found myself occupying had set",Swann's Way
7178,"against the walls, on three sides of it, a series of low book-cases",Swann's Way
7178,"with glass fronts, in which, according to where they stood, by a law",Swann's Way
7178,"of nature which he had, perhaps, forgotten to take into account, was",Swann's Way
7178,"reflected this or that section of the ever-changing view of the sea, so",Swann's Way
7178,"that the walls were lined with a frieze of seascapes, interrupted only",Swann's Way
7178,by the polished mahogany of the actual shelves. And so effective was,Swann's Way
7178,this that the whole room had the appearance of one of those model,Swann's Way
7178,"bedrooms which you see nowadays in Housing Exhibitions, decorated with",Swann's Way
7178,works of art which are calculated by their designer to refresh the eyes,Swann's Way
7178,"of whoever may ultimately have to sleep in the rooms, the subjects being",Swann's Way
7178,kept in some degree of harmony with the locality and surroundings of the,Swann's Way
7178,houses for which the rooms are planned.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real",Swann's Way
7178,"Balbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy",Swann's Way
7178,"days, when the wind was so strong that Françoise, as she took me to",Swann's Way
7178,"the Champs-Elysées, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the",Swann's Way
7178,"street, or I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and",Swann's Way
7178,"would recount to me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and",Swann's Way
7178,shipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing,Swann's Way
7178,"more than to behold a storm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as",Swann's Way
7178,a momentary revelation of the true life of nature; or rather there,Swann's Way
7178,were for me no mighty spectacles save those which I knew to be,Swann's Way
7178,"not artificially composed for my entertainment, but necessary and",Swann's Way
7178,"unalterable,--the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art. I was",Swann's Way
7178,"not curious, I did not thirst to know anything save what I believed",Swann's Way
7178,"to be more genuine than myself, what had for me the supreme merit of",Swann's Way
7178,"shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius, or of the force",Swann's Way
7178,"or the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself,",Swann's Way
7178,"without human interference. Just as the lovely sound of her voice,",Swann's Way
7178,"reproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never console a",Swann's Way
7178,"man for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a storm",Swann's Way
7178,would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the,Swann's Way
7178,"Exhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine,",Swann's Way
7178,"that the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an",Swann's Way
7178,"embankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by",Swann's Way
7178,"all the feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite",Swann's Way
7178,thing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind. The less she,Swann's Way
7178,"bore their imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my",Swann's Way
7178,"heart. And, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which",Swann's Way
7178,"Legrandin had cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst",Swann's Way
7178,"of ""that funereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed,",Swann's Way
7178,"for six months in the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the",Swann's Way
7178,waves.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""You feel, there, below your feet still,"" he had told me, ""far more even",Swann's Way

7178,"upon it, without power, however, to modify that oldest bone in the",Swann's Way
7178,earth's skeleton) you feel there that you are actually at the land's,Swann's Way
7178,"end of France, of Europe, of the Old World. And it is the ultimate",Swann's Way
7178,"encampment of the fishermen, precisely like the fishermen who have",Swann's Way
7178,"lived since the world's beginning, facing the everlasting kingdom of",Swann's Way
7178,"the sea-fogs and shadows of the night."" One day when, at Combray, I had",Swann's Way
7178,"spoken of this coast, this Balbec, before M. Swann, hoping to learn from",Swann's Way
7178,him whether it was the best point to select for seeing the most violent,Swann's Way
7178,"storms, he had replied: ""I should think I did know Balbec! The church",Swann's Way
7178,"at Balbec, built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and still",Swann's Way
7178,"half romanesque, is perhaps the most curious example to be found of our",Swann's Way
7178,"Norman gothic, and so exceptional that one is tempted to describe it",Swann's Way
7178,"as Persian in its inspiration."" And that region, which, until then, had",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to me to be nothing else than a part of immemorial nature, that",Swann's Way
7178,had remained contemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology--and as,Swann's Way
7178,"remote from human history as the Ocean itself, or the Great Bear, with",Swann's Way
7178,"its wild race of fishermen for whom, no more than for their whales,",Swann's Way
7178,had there been any Middle Ages--it had been a great joy to me to see,Swann's Way
7178,"it suddenly take its place in the order of the centuries, with a stored",Swann's Way
7178,"consciousness of the romanesque epoch, and to know that the gothic",Swann's Way
7178,"trefoil had come to diversify those wild rocks also, at the appointed",Swann's Way
7178,"hour, like those frail but hardy plants which, in the Polar regions,",Swann's Way
7178,"when the spring returns, scatter their stars about the eternal snows.",Swann's Way
7178,And if gothic art brought to those places and people a classification,Swann's Way
7178,"which, otherwise, they lacked, they too conferred one upon it in return.",Swann's Way
7178,"I tried to form a picture in my mind of how those fishermen had lived,",Swann's Way
7178,the timid and unsuspected essay towards social intercourse which they,Swann's Way
7178,"had attempted there, clustered upon a promontory of the shores of Hell,",Swann's Way
7178,at the foot of the cliffs of death; and gothic art seemed to me a more,Swann's Way
7178,"living thing now that, detaching it from the towns in which, until then,",Swann's Way
7178,"I had always imagined it, I could see how, in a particular instance,",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a reef of savage rocks, it had taken root and grown until it",Swann's Way
7178,flowered in a tapering spire. I was taken to see reproductions of the,Swann's Way
7178,"most famous of the statues at Balbec,--shaggy, blunt-faced Apostles,",Swann's Way
7178,"the Virgin from the porch,--and I could scarcely breathe for joy at the",Swann's Way
7178,"thought that I might myself, one day, see them take a solid form against",Swann's Way
7178,"their eternal background of salt fog. Thereafter, on dear, tempestuous",Swann's Way
7178,"February nights, the wind--breathing into my heart, which it shook no",Swann's Way
7178,"less violently than the chimney of my bedroom, the project of a visit to",Swann's Way
7178,Balbec--blended in me the desire for gothic architecture with that for a,Swann's Way
7178,storm upon the sea.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the generous",Swann's Way
7178,"train at one twenty-two, of which never without a palpitating heart",Swann's Way
7178,"could I read, in the railway company's bills or in advertisements of",Swann's Way
7178,"circular tours, the hour of departure: it seemed to me to cut, at",Swann's Way
7178,"a precise point in every afternoon, a most fascinating groove, a",Swann's Way
7178,"mysterious mark, from which the diverted hours still led one on, of",Swann's Way
7178,"course, towards evening, towards to-morrow morning, but to an evening",Swann's Way
7178,"and morning which one would behold, not in Paris but in one of those",Swann's Way
7178,towns through which the train passed and among which it allowed one,Swann's Way
7178,"to choose; for it stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitré, at",Swann's Way
7178,"Questambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at",Swann's Way
7178,"Benodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and progressed magnificently",Swann's Way
7178,"surcharged with names which it offered me, so that, among them all, I",Swann's Way
7178,"did not know which to choose, so impossible was it to sacrifice any.",Swann's Way
7178,"But even without waiting for the train next day, I could, by rising and",Swann's Way
7178,"dressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very evening, should",Swann's Way
7178,"my parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread westward over the",Swann's Way
7178,"raging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek shelter in that church",Swann's Way
7178,"in the Persian manner. But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when",Swann's Way
7178,"my parents had promised to let me spend them, for once, in the North",Swann's Way
7178,"of Italy, lo! in place of those dreams of tempests, by which I had been",Swann's Way
7178,"entirely possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in",Swann's Way
7178,"from all sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts,",Swann's Way
7178,"beside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers",Swann's Way
7178,"the sea-birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away",Swann's Way
7178,"all their charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could",Swann's Way
7178,"only have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream",Swann's Way
7178,"of the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still",Swann's Way
7178,"pricking with all the needle-points of the winter's frost, but that",Swann's Way
7178,"which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole,",Swann's Way
7178,"and gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those in Fra",Swann's Way
7178,"Angelico's pictures. From that moment, only sunlight, perfumes, colours,",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to me to have any value; for this alternation of images had,Swann's Way
7178,"effected a change of front in my desire, and--as abrupt as those that",Swann's Way
7178,"occur sometimes in music,--a complete change of tone in my sensibility.",Swann's Way
7178,Thus it came about that a mere atmospheric variation would be sufficient,Swann's Way
7178,"to provoke in me that modulation, without there being any need for me to",Swann's Way
7178,"await the return of a season. For often we find a day, in one, that has",Swann's Way
7178,"strayed from another season, and makes us live in that other, summons at",Swann's Way
7178,"once into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and",Swann's Way
7178,"interrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving, by inserting,",Swann's Way
7178,"out of its turn, too early or too late, this leaf, torn from another",Swann's Way
7178,"chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon it happened",Swann's Way
7178,"that, like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health",Swann's Way
7178,"can derive but an accidental and all too modest benefit, until the day",Swann's Way
7178,"when science takes control of them, and, producing them at will, places",Swann's Way
7178,"in our hands the power to order their appearance, withdrawn from",Swann's Way
7178,the tutelage and independent of the consent of chance; similarly the,Swann's Way
7178,production of these dreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend,Swann's Way
7178,entirely upon the changes of the seasons and of the weather. I need,Swann's Way
7178,"only, to make them reappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice,",Swann's Way
7178,"Florence, within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the",Swann's Way
7178,longing inspired in me by the places for which they stood. Even in,Swann's Way
7178,"spring, to come in a book upon the name of Balbec sufficed to awaken",Swann's Way
7178,in me the desire for storms at sea and for the Norman gothic; even on a,Swann's Way
7178,stormy day the name of Florence or of Venice would awaken the desire for,Swann's Way
7178,"sunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and for Santa Maria",Swann's Way
7178,del Fiore.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,But if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that I had formed,Swann's Way
7178,"of these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subordinating",Swann's Way
7178,its reappearance in me to their own special laws; and in consequence of,Swann's Way
7178,"this they made it more beautiful, but at the same time more different",Swann's Way
7178,"from anything that the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could in reality be,",Swann's Way
7178,"and, by increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination, aggravated",Swann's Way
7178,the disenchantment that was in store for me when I set out upon my,Swann's Way
7178,travels. They magnified the idea that I formed of certain points on the,Swann's Way
7178,"earth's surface, making them more special, and in consequence more",Swann's Way
7178,"real. I did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic",Swann's Way
7178,"buildings, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there",Swann's Way
7178,"of a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them",Swann's Way
7178,"as on an unknown thing, different from all the rest, a thing for which",Swann's Way
7178,"my soul was athirst, by the knowledge of which it would benefit. How",Swann's Way
7178,much more individual still was the character that they assumed from,Swann's Way
7178,"being designated by names, names that were only for themselves, proper",Swann's Way
7178,names such as people have. Words present to us little pictures of,Swann's Way
7178,"things, lucid and normal, like the pictures that are hung on the walls",Swann's Way
7178,of schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by,Swann's Way
7178,"a carpenter's bench, a bird, an ant-hill; things chosen as typical of",Swann's Way
7178,everything else of the same sort. But names present to us--of persons,Swann's Way
7178,"and of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual, as unique,",Swann's Way
7178,"like persons--a confused picture, which draws from the names, from",Swann's Way
7178,"the brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in which it is",Swann's Way
7178,"uniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely",Swann's Way
7178,"red, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the process used",Swann's Way
7178,"in their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer's part, are blue or",Swann's Way
7178,"red not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church and the",Swann's Way
7178,"people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I most",Swann's Way
7178,"longed to visit, after reading the _Chartreuse_, seeming to me compact",Swann's Way
7178,"and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such or",Swann's Way
7178,"such a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me the",Swann's Way
7178,pleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact,Swann's Way
7178,"and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses",Swann's Way
7178,"in any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid",Swann's Way
7178,"of that heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air",Swann's Way
7178,"stirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness",Swann's Way
7178,"and the reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was",Swann's Way
7178,"of a town miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called",Swann's Way
7178,"the City of the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As",Swann's Way
7178,"for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of",Swann's Way
7178,Norman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which,Swann's Way
7178,"it was fashioned, one sees depicted still the representation of some",Swann's Way
7178,"long-abolished custom, of some feudal right, of the former condition of",Swann's Way
7178,"some place, of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language, which had",Swann's Way
7178,shaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which I never doubted,Swann's Way
7178,"that I should find spoken there at once, even by the inn-keeper who",Swann's Way
7178,"would pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch",Swann's Way
7178,"the turbulent sea, unchained, before the church; to whom I lent the",Swann's Way
7178,"aspect, disputatious, solemn and mediaeval, of some character in one of",Swann's Way
7178,the old romances.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Had my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if not",Swann's Way
7178,"actually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just once, so",Swann's Way
7178,as to become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy,Swann's Way
7178,"or of Brittany, that one twenty-two train into which I had so often",Swann's Way
7178,"clambered in imagination, I should have preferred to stop, and to alight",Swann's Way
7178,"from it, at the most beautiful of its towns; but in vain might I",Swann's Way
7178,"compare and contrast them; how was one to choose, any more than between",Swann's Way
7178,"individual people, who are not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty",Swann's Way
7178,"in its noble coronet of rusty lace, whose highest point caught the light",Swann's Way
7178,"of the old gold of its second syllable; Vitré, whose acute accent barred",Swann's Way
7178,"its ancient glass with wooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness",Swann's Way
7178,"ranged from egg-shell yellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman",Swann's Way
7178,"Cathedral, which its final consonants, rich and yellowing, crowned with",Swann's Way
7178,"a tower of butter; Lannion with the rumble and buzz, in the silence of",Swann's Way
7178,"its village street, of the fly on the wheel of the coach; Questambert,",Swann's Way
7178,"Pontorson, ridiculously silly and simple, white feathers and yellow",Swann's Way
7178,beaks strewn along the road to those well-watered and poetic spots;,Swann's Way
7178,"Benodet, a name scarcely moored that seemed to be striving to draw the",Swann's Way
7178,"river down into the tangle of its seaweeds; Pont-Aven, the snowy, rosy",Swann's Way
7178,"flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif, tremulously reflected in",Swann's Way
7178,"the greenish waters of a canal; Quimperlé, more firmly attached, this,",Swann's Way
7178,"and since the Middle Ages, among the rivulets with which it babbled,",Swann's Way
7178,"threading their pearls upon a grey background, like the pattern made,",Swann's Way
7178,"through the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight changed into",Swann's Way
7178,blunt points of tarnished silver?,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"These images were false for another reason also; namely, that they",Swann's Way
7178,were necessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my,Swann's Way
7178,"imagination aspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and",Swann's Way
7178,"without any immediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody",Swann's Way
7178,"of names; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams,",Swann's Way
7178,those names now magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very,Swann's Way
7178,comprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them,Swann's Way
7178,"two or three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would",Swann's Way
7178,"lie there side by side, without interval or partition; in the name of",Swann's Way
7178,"Balbec, as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which",Swann's Way
7178,"one buys at sea-side places, I could distinguish waves surging round",Swann's Way
7178,"a church built in the Persian manner. Perhaps, indeed, the enforced",Swann's Way
7178,simplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they,Swann's Way
7178,"had over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we should go",Swann's Way
7178,"for the Easter holidays to Florence and Venice, not finding room",Swann's Way
7178,to introduce into the name of Florence the elements that ordinarily,Swann's Way
7178,"constitute a town, I was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from",Swann's Way
7178,"the impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what I supposed to be,",Swann's Way
7178,"in its essentials, the genius of Giotto. All the more--and because one",Swann's Way
7178,cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space--like some,Swann's Way
7178,of Giotto's paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments,Swann's Way
7178,"the same person engaged in different actions, here lying on his bed,",Swann's Way
7178,"there just about to mount his horse, the name of Florence was divided",Swann's Way
7178,"into two compartments. In one, beneath an architectural dais, I gazed",Swann's Way
7178,"upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight,",Swann's Way
7178,"dusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since",Swann's Way
7178,I thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and,Swann's Way
7178,"enveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the life not yet",Swann's Way
7178,"lived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them, gave to the",Swann's Way
7178,"most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same attraction",Swann's Way
7178,"that they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved swiftly--so as",Swann's Way
7178,"to arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was spread for me,",Swann's Way
7178,with fruit and a flask of Chianti--across a Ponte Vecchio heaped with,Swann's Way
7178,"jonquils, narcissi and anemones. That (for all that I was still in",Swann's Way
7178,"Paris) was what I saw, and not what was actually round about me. Even",Swann's Way
7178,"from the simplest, the most realistic point of view, the countries for",Swann's Way
7178,"which we long occupy, at any given moment, a far larger place in our",Swann's Way
7178,"true life than the country in which we may happen to be. Doubtless, if,",Swann's Way
7178,"at that time, I had paid more attention to what was in my mind when I",Swann's Way
7178,"pronounced the words ""going to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice,""",Swann's Way
7178,"I should have realised that what I saw was in no sense a town, but",Swann's Way
7178,"something as different from anything that I knew, something as delicious",Swann's Way
7178,as might be for a human race whose whole existence had passed in a,Swann's Way
7178,"series of late winter afternoons, that inconceivable marvel, a morning",Swann's Way
7178,"in spring. These images, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling all my",Swann's Way
7178,"nights and days, differentiated this period in my life from those which",Swann's Way
7178,had gone before it (and might easily have been confused with it by,Swann's Way
7178,"an observer who saw things only from without, that is to say, who saw",Swann's Way
7178,"nothing), as in an opera a fresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere",Swann's Way
7178,which one could never have suspected if one had done no more than,Swann's Way
7178,"read the libretto, still less if one had remained outside the theatre,",Swann's Way
7178,"counting only the minutes as they passed. And besides, even from the",Swann's Way
7178,"point of view of mere quantity, in our life the days are not all equal.",Swann's Way
7178,"To reach the end of a day, natures that are slightly nervous, as",Swann's Way
7178,"mine was, make use, like motor-cars, of different 'speeds.' There are",Swann's Way
7178,"mountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an infinite time to",Swann's Way
7178,"pass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go at full tilt,",Swann's Way
7178,singing as one goes. During this month--in which I went laboriously,Swann's Way
7178,"over, as over a tune, though never to my satisfaction, these visions of",Swann's Way
7178,"Florence, Venice, Pisa, from which the desire that they excited in me",Swann's Way
7178,drew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been,Swann's Way
7178,"love, love for another person--I never ceased to believe that they",Swann's Way
7178,"corresponded to a reality independent of myself, and they made me",Swann's Way
7178,conscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a,Swann's Way
7178,"Christian in the primitive age of faith, on the eve of his entry into",Swann's Way
7178,"Paradise. Moreover, without my paying any heed to the contradiction that",Swann's Way
7178,there was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense,Swann's Way
7178,what had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by,Swann's Way
7178,"my senses at all--though all the more tempting to them, in consequence,",Swann's Way
7178,more different from anything that they knew--it was that which recalled,Swann's Way
7178,"to me the reality of these visions, which inflamed my desire all the",Swann's Way
7178,more by seeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied.,Swann's Way
7178,And for all that the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for,Swann's Way
7178,"aesthetic enjoyments, the guide-books ministered even more to it than",Swann's Way
7178,"books on aesthetics, and, more again than the guide-books, the railway",Swann's Way
7178,time-tables. What moved me was the thought that this Florence which I,Swann's Way
7178,"could see, so near and yet inaccessible, in my imagination, if the tract",Swann's Way
7178,"which separated it from me, in myself, was not one that I might cross,",Swann's Way
7178,"could yet be reached by a circuit, by a digression, were I to take",Swann's Way
7178,"the plain, terrestrial path. When I repeated to myself, giving thus a",Swann's Way
7178,"special value to what I was going to see, that Venice was the ""School of",Swann's Way
7178,"Giorgione, the home of Titian, the most complete museum of the domestic",Swann's Way
7178,"architecture of the Middle Ages,"" I felt happy indeed. As I was even",Swann's Way
7178,"more when, on one of my walks, as I stepped out briskly on account",Swann's Way
7178,"of the weather, which, after several days of a precocious spring, had",Swann's Way
7178,relapsed into winter (like the weather that we had invariably found,Swann's Way
7178,"awaiting us at Combray, in Holy Week),--seeing upon the boulevards that",Swann's Way
7178,"the chestnut-trees, though plunged in a glacial atmosphere that soaked",Swann's Way
7178,"through them like a stream of water, were none the less beginning,",Swann's Way
7178,"punctual guests, arrayed already for the party, and admitting no",Swann's Way
7178,"discouragement, to shape and chisel and curve in its frozen lumps the",Swann's Way
7178,irrepressible verdure whose steady growth the abortive power of the,Swann's Way
7178,cold might hinder but could not succeed in restraining--I reflected that,Swann's Way
7178,already the Ponte Vecchio was heaped high with an abundance of hyacinths,Swann's Way
7178,"and anemones, and that the spring sunshine was already tinging the waves",Swann's Way
7178,"of the Grand Canal with so dusky an azure, with emeralds so splendid",Swann's Way
7178,that when they washed and were broken against the foot of one of,Swann's Way
7178,Titian's paintings they could vie with it in the richness of their,Swann's Way
7178,"colouring. I could no longer contain my joy when my father, in the",Swann's Way
7178,"intervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the cold, began",Swann's Way
7178,"to look out which were the best trains, and when I understood that by",Swann's Way
7178,"making one's way, after luncheon, into the coal-grimed laboratory, the",Swann's Way
7178,wizard's cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of its,Swann's Way
7178,"surroundings, one could awaken, next morning, in the city of marble",Swann's Way
7178,"and gold, in which ""the building of the wall was of jasper and the",Swann's Way
7178,"foundation of the wall an emerald."" So that it and the City of the",Swann's Way
7178,Lilies were not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my,Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure in front of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain",Swann's Way
7178,distance from Paris which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to,Swann's Way
7178,"see them, at their appointed place on the earth's surface, and at no",Swann's Way
7178,other; in a word they were entirely real. They became even more real,Swann's Way
7178,"to me when my father, by saying: ""Well, you can stay in Venice from the",Swann's Way
7178,"20th to the 29th, and reach Florence on Easter morning,"" made them both",Swann's Way
7178,"emerge, no longer only from the abstraction of Space, but from that",Swann's Way
7178,"imaginary Time in which we place not one, merely, but several of",Swann's Way
7178,"our travels at once, which do not greatly tax us since they are but",Swann's Way
7178,"possibilities,--that Time which reconstructs itself so effectively that",Swann's Way
7178,one can spend it again in one town after one has already spent it in,Swann's Way
7178,"another--and consecrated to them some of those actual, calendar days",Swann's Way
7178,"which are certificates of the genuineness of what one does on them, for",Swann's Way
7178,"those unique days are consumed by being used, they do not return, one",Swann's Way
7178,cannot live them again here when one has lived them elsewhere; I felt,Swann's Way
7178,that it was towards the week that would begin with the Monday on which,Swann's Way
7178,the laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that I had stained,Swann's Way
7178,"with ink, that they were hastening to busy themselves with the duty",Swann's Way
7178,"of emerging from that ideal Time in which they did not, as yet, exist,",Swann's Way
7178,"those two Queen Cities of which I was soon to be able, by the most",Swann's Way
7178,"absorbing kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on a",Swann's Way
7178,"page of my own life. But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme",Swann's Way
7178,pinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the,Swann's Way
7178,"revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the",Swann's Way
7178,"light reflected from Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite",Swann's Way
7178,"so many promptings, continued to imagine, the men ""majestic and terrible",Swann's Way
7178,"as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds",Swann's Way
7178,"of their blood-red cloaks,"" who would be walking in Venice next week, on",Swann's Way
7178,"the Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom,",Swann's Way
7178,"in an enlarged photograph of St. Mark's that had been lent to me, the",Swann's Way
7178,"operator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when",Swann's Way
7178,"I heard my father say: ""It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand",Swann's Way
7178,"Canal; whatever you do, don't forget to pack your winter greatcoat and",Swann's Way
7178,"your thick suit."" At these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy;",Swann's Way
7178,"a thing that I had until then deemed impossible, I felt myself to be",Swann's Way
7178,"penetrating indeed between those ""rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the",Swann's Way
7178,"Indian Ocean""; by a supreme muscular effort, a long way in excess of my",Swann's Way
7178,"real strength, stripping myself, as of a shell that served no purpose,",Swann's Way
7178,"of the air in my own room which surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal",Swann's Way
7178,"quantity of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere, indescribable and",Swann's Way
7178,peculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had,Swann's Way
7178,secreted in the name of Venice; I could feel at work within me a,Swann's Way
7178,miraculous disincarnation; it was at once accompanied by that vague,Swann's Way
7178,desire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat; and,Swann's Way
7178,they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor,Swann's Way
7178,"not only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to Florence and",Swann's Way
7178,"Venice was absolutely out of the question, but warned them that, even",Swann's Way
7178,"when I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a year,",Swann's Way
7178,"give up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that was",Swann's Way
7178,liable to excite me.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And, alas, he forbade also, most categorically, my being allowed to go",Swann's Way
7178,"to the theatre, to hear Berma; the sublime artist, whose genius Bergotte",Swann's Way
7178,"had proclaimed, might, by introducing me to something else that was,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, as important and as beautiful, have consoled me for not having",Swann's Way
7178,"been to Florence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. My parents had",Swann's Way
7178,"to be content with sending me, every day, to the Champs-Elysées, in",Swann's Way
7178,the custody of a person who would see that I did not tire myself; this,Swann's Way
7178,"person was none other than Françoise, who had entered our service",Swann's Way
7178,after the death of my aunt Léonie. Going to the Champs-Elysées I found,Swann's Way
7178,unendurable. If only Bergotte had described the place in one of his,Swann's Way
7178,"books, I should, no doubt, have longed to see and to know it, like so",Swann's Way
7178,many things else of which a simulacrum had first found its way into,Swann's Way
7178,"my imagination. That kept things warm, made them live, gave them",Swann's Way
7178,"personality, and I sought then to find their counterpart in reality,",Swann's Way

7178,"One day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses,",Swann's Way
7178,Françoise had taken me for an excursion--across the frontier guarded at,Swann's Way
7178,regular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women--into,Swann's Way
7178,"those neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the",Swann's Way
7178,"passers-by were strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had",Swann's Way
7178,gone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to,Swann's Way
7178,a shrubbery of laurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad,Swann's Way
7178,"lawn, of meagre close-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated,",Swann's Way
7178,"at its far end, by a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a",Swann's Way
7178,"little girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from",Swann's Way
7178,"the path, another little girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering",Swann's Way
7178,"up her battledore, called out sharply: ""Good-bye, Gilberte, I'm going",Swann's Way
7178,"home now; don't forget, we're coming to you this evening, after dinner.""",Swann's Way
7178,"The name Gilberte passed close by me, evoking all the more forcibly her",Swann's Way
7178,"whom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her, as one speaks",Swann's Way
7178,"of a man in his absence, but was directly addressed to her; it passed",Swann's Way
7178,"thus close by me, in action, so to speak, with a force that",Swann's Way
7178,increased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to,Swann's Way
7178,"its target;--carrying in its wake, I could feel, the knowledge, the",Swann's Way
7178,impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged not to me but,Swann's Way
7178,"to the friend who called to her, everything that, while she uttered the",Swann's Way
7178,"words, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her memory, of",Swann's Way
7178,"their daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each other, of",Swann's Way
7178,"that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all the more",Swann's Way
7178,"painful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable to this",Swann's Way
7178,happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able to,Swann's Way
7178,"penetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted cry:",Swann's Way
7178,letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that message,Swann's Way
7178,"had distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain invisible",Swann's Way
7178,"points in Mlle. Swann's life, from the evening to come, as it would be,",Swann's Way
7178,"after dinner, at her home,--forming, on its celestial passage through",Swann's Way
7178,"the midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud,",Swann's Way
7178,"exquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin's",Swann's Way
7178,"gardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with",Swann's Way
7178,"chariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting,",Swann's Way
7178,"finally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a",Swann's Way
7178,"scrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player,",Swann's Way
7178,"who continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess,",Swann's Way
7178,"with a blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little",Swann's Way
7178,"band of light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a",Swann's Way
7178,carpet on which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering,Swann's Way
7178,"feet, nostalgic and profane, while Françoise shouted: ""Come on, button",Swann's Way
7178,"up your coat, look, and let's get away!"" and I remarked for the first",Swann's Way
7178,"time how common her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather",Swann's Way
7178,in her hat.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Only, would _she_ come again to the Champs-Elysées? Next day she was",Swann's Way
7178,not there; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time,Swann's Way
7178,"revolving round the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such",Swann's Way
7178,"effect that once, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a",Swann's Way
7178,"prisoner's base, she sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete",Swann's Way
7178,"their side, and from that day I played with her whenever she came.",Swann's Way
7178,But this did not happen every day; there were days when she had,Swann's Way
7178,"been prevented from coming by her lessons, by her catechism, by a",Swann's Way
7178,"luncheon-party, by the whole of that life, separated from my own, which",Swann's Way
7178,"twice only, condensed into the name of Gilberte, I had felt pass so",Swann's Way
7178,"painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane near Combray and on the",Swann's Way
7178,grass of the Champs-Elysées. On such days she would have told us,Swann's Way
7178,beforehand that we should not see her; if it were because of her,Swann's Way
7178,"lessons, she would say: ""It is too tiresome, I sha'n't be able to come",Swann's Way
7178,"to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me,"" with an",Swann's Way
7178,"air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the other hand,",Swann's Way
7178,"she had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this, asked her",Swann's Way
7178,"whether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: ""Indeed I hope",Swann's Way
7178,"not! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend's."" But on these",Swann's Way
7178,"days I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on others,",Swann's Way
7178,"without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or some such",Swann's Way
7178,"thing, and next day she would say: ""Oh, yes! I went out with Mamma,""",Swann's Way
7178,"as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not the",Swann's Way
7178,greatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the days,Swann's Way
7178,"of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of",Swann's Way
7178,"the rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elysées.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not",Swann's Way
7178,"cease to interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady",Swann's Way
7178,"opposite, just inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to",Swann's Way
7178,"myself: ""That lady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which",Swann's Way
7178,"one can go out. Why should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?"" But",Swann's Way
7178,"the day grew dark. My mother said that it might clear again, that one",Swann's Way
7178,"burst of sunshine would be enough, but that more probably it would rain;",Swann's Way
7178,"and if it rained, of what use would it be to go to the Champs-Elysées?",Swann's Way
7178,"And so, from breakfast-time, my anxious eyes never left the uncertain,",Swann's Way
7178,"clouded sky. It remained dark. Outside the window, the balcony was grey.",Swann's Way
7178,"Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I did not indeed see a less negative",Swann's Way
7178,"colour, but I felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour,",Swann's Way
7178,the pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light.,Swann's Way
7178,A moment later the balcony was as pale and luminous as a standing water,Swann's Way
7178,"at dawn, and a thousand shadows from the iron-work of its balustrade had",Swann's Way
7178,come to rest on it. A breath of wind dispersed them; the stone grew,Swann's Way
7178,"dark again, but, like tamed creatures, they returned; they began,",Swann's Way
7178,"imperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those continuous",Swann's Way
7178,"crescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry a single",Swann's Way
7178,"note to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through all the",Swann's Way
7178,"intermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable gold of",Swann's Way
7178,"fine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of the",Swann's Way
7178,"balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a",Swann's Way
7178,fineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to,Swann's Way
7178,"indicate a deliberate application, an artist's satisfaction, and with so",Swann's Way
7178,"much relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre",Swann's Way
7178,and happy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay,Swann's Way
7178,reflected on that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges,Swann's Way
7178,of happiness and peace of mind.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Brief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the",Swann's Way
7178,"most depressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate",Swann's Way
7178,"windows; to me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared",Swann's Way
7178,"upon our balcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte,",Swann's Way
7178,"who was perhaps already in the Champs-Elysées, and as soon as I arrived",Swann's Way
7178,"there would greet me with: ""Let's begin at once. You are on my side.""",Swann's Way
7178,"Frail, swept away by a breath, but at the same time in harmony, not with",Swann's Way
7178,"the season, with the hour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which",Swann's Way
7178,"the day will deny or fulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure, the pleasure of loving and of being loved; more soft,",Swann's Way
7178,"more warm upon the stone than even moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine",Swann's Way
7178,"sufficing for its birth, and for the birth of joy, even in the heart of",Swann's Way
7178,winter.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the",Swann's Way
7178,fine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees,Swann's Way
7178,"were hidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but",Swann's Way
7178,when the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte,Swann's Way
7178,"would venture out, then suddenly--inspiring my mother to say: ""Look,",Swann's Way
7178,it's quite fine now; I think you might perhaps try going to the,Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées after all.""--on the mantle of snow that swathed the",Swann's Way
7178,"balcony, the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold, with",Swann's Way
7178,"embroidered patches of dark shadow. That day we found no one there, or",Swann's Way
7178,"else a solitary girl, on the point of departure, who assured me that",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte was not coming. The chairs, deserted by the imposing but",Swann's Way
7178,"uninspiring company of governesses, stood empty. Only, near the grass,",Swann's Way
7178,"was sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers, dressed",Swann's Way
7178,"always in an identical style, splendid and sombre, to make whose",Swann's Way
7178,"acquaintance I would have, at that period, sacrificed, had it lain in my",Swann's Way
7178,"power, all the greatest opportunities in my life to come. For Gilberte",Swann's Way
7178,went up every day to speak to her; she used to ask Gilberte for news of,Swann's Way
7178,"her ""dearest mother"" and it struck me that, if I had known her, I should",Swann's Way
7178,"have been for Gilberte some one wholly different, some one who knew",Swann's Way
7178,people in her parents' world. While her grandchildren played together at,Swann's Way
7178,"a little distance, she would sit and read the Débats, which she called",Swann's Way
7178,"""My old _Débats_!"" as, with an aristocratic familiarity, she would say,",Swann's Way
7178,"speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the chairs, ""My",Swann's Way
7178,"old friend the police-sergeant,"" or ""The chair-keeper and I, who are old",Swann's Way
7178,"friends.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont",Swann's Way
7178,"de la Concorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even",Swann's Way
7178,"children, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded,",Swann's Way
7178,"defenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysées;",Swann's Way
7178,I was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and,Swann's Way
7178,"the white lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had",Swann's Way
7178,"been cleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a",Swann's Way
7178,long pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady,Swann's Way
7178,"herself, having folded up her _Débats_, asked a passing nursemaid",Swann's Way
7178,"the time, thanking her with ""How very good of you!"" then begged the",Swann's Way
7178,"road-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding",Swann's Way
7178,"""A thousand thanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!"" Suddenly",Swann's Way
7178,"the sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses,",Swann's Way
7178,"against the opening horizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign,",Swann's Way
7178,Mademoiselle's blue feather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed,Swann's Way
7178,"towards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened",Swann's Way
7178,"by the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before",Swann's Way
7178,"she reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her",Swann's Way
7178,"balance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending",Swann's Way
7178,"that she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly",Swann's Way
7178,"advanced, as though to embrace me. ""Bravo! bravo! that's splendid;",Swann's Way
7178,"'topping,' I should say, like you--'sporting,' I suppose I ought to say,",Swann's Way
7178,"only I'm a hundred-and-one, a woman of the old school,"" exclaimed the",Swann's Way
7178,"lady, uttering, on behalf of the voiceless Champs-Elysées, their thanks",Swann's Way
7178,"to Gilberte for having come, without letting herself be frightened",Swann's Way
7178,"away by the weather. ""You are like me, faithful at all costs to our old",Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées; we are two brave souls! You wouldn't believe me, I dare",Swann's Way
7178,"say, if I told you that I love them, even like this. This snow (I know,",Swann's Way
7178,"you'll laugh at me), it makes me think of ermine!"" And the old lady",Swann's Way
7178,began to laugh herself.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"The first of these days--to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that",Swann's Way
7178,"were able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness",Swann's Way
7178,"of a day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because",Swann's Way
7178,it changed the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary,Swann's Way
7178,"scene of our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in",Swann's Way
7178,"dust-sheets--that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of",Swann's Way
7178,"my love, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share",Swann's Way
7178,"with me. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to",Swann's Way
7178,"be thus alone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but",Swann's Way
7178,"also on her part--as though she had come there solely to please me, and",Swann's Way
7178,"in such weather--it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days",Swann's Way
7178,"on which she had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order",Swann's Way
7178,to come to me in the Champs-Elysées; I acquired more confidence in the,Swann's Way
7178,"vitality, in the future of a friendship which could remain so much alive",Swann's Way
7178,"amid the torpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while",Swann's Way
7178,"she dropped pellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what",Swann's Way
7178,seemed to me at once a predilection that she shewed for me in thus,Swann's Way
7178,"tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new, this wintry land,",Swann's Way
7178,and a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times.,Swann's Way
7178,"Presently, one after another, like shyly hopping sparrows, her friends",Swann's Way
7178,"arrived, black against the snow. We got ready to play and, since this",Swann's Way
7178,"day which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up,",Swann's Way
7178,"before the game started, to the friend with the sharp voice whom I had",Swann's Way
7178,"heard, that first day, calling Gilberte by name, she said to me: ""No,",Swann's Way
7178,"no, I'm sure you'd much rather be in Gilberte's camp; besides, look,",Swann's Way
7178,"she's signalling to you."" She was in fact summoning me to cross the",Swann's Way
7178,"snowy lawn to her camp, to 'take the field,' which the sun, by casting",Swann's Way
7178,"over it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had",Swann's Way
7178,turned into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"This day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it",Swann's Way
7178,"happened, one of the few on which I was not unduly wretched.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"For, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a",Swann's Way
7178,"single day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my",Swann's Way
7178,"grandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the",Swann's Way
7178,"instinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street",Swann's Way
7178,"and killed, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the",Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone),",Swann's Way
7178,"yet those moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited",Swann's Way
7178,"with so much impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered",Swann's Way
7178,"with excitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the",Swann's Way
7178,"world, were by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they",Swann's Way
7178,"were the only moments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous,",Swann's Way
7178,"undistracted attention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom",Swann's Way
7178,"of pleasure. All the time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see",Swann's Way
7178,"her, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her,",Swann's Way
7178,"I was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my",Swann's Way
7178,"love corresponded. Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me.",Swann's Way
7178,"Far from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom",Swann's Way
7178,"she preferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was",Swann's Way
7178,"always willing to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive",Swann's Way
7178,"enough to the game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent",Swann's Way
7178,"coldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her",Swann's Way
7178,"a creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a",Swann's Way
7178,"love that Gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the love that I felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the",Swann's Way
7178,assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which,Swann's Way
7178,"I was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my",Swann's Way
7178,feelings with regard to her I had never yet ventured to express to her,Swann's Way
7178,"in words. Of course, on every page of my exercise-books, I wrote out,",Swann's Way
7178,"in endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those",Swann's Way
7178,"vague lines which I might trace, without her having to think, on that",Swann's Way
7178,"account, of me, I felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire,",Swann's Way
7178,"which they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely",Swann's Way
7178,"personal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. The most important thing",Swann's Way
7178,"was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and should have an",Swann's Way
7178,"opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then,",Swann's Way
7178,would not officially (so to speak) have begun. Doubtless the various,Swann's Way
7178,reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less,Swann's Way
7178,"urgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in",Swann's Way
7178,"the culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which",Swann's Way
7178,"we derive from thinking of a woman, as I was thinking of Gilberte,",Swann's Way
7178,without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds,Swann's Way
7178,"to the reality,--and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to",Swann's Way
7178,"be sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure",Swann's Way
7178,"of confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the",Swann's Way
7178,"passion that she has for us, like those Japanese gardeners who, to",Swann's Way
7178,"obtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. But at the period",Swann's Way
7178,"when I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really",Swann's Way
7178,"exist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount",Swann's Way
7178,"the obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in",Swann's Way
7178,which we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me,Swann's Way
7178,"that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of",Swann's Way
7178,"a confession a pretence of indifference, I should not only have been",Swann's Way
7178,"depriving myself of one of the joys of which I had most often dreamed,",Swann's Way
7178,"I should have been fabricating, of my own free will, a love that was",Swann's Way
7178,"artificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose",Swann's Way
7178,mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have been declining to,Swann's Way
7178,follow.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysées,--and, as at first sight",Swann's Way
7178,"it appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it",Swann's Way
7178,"undergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent",Swann's Way
7178,cause--as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the,Swann's Way
7178,sight of whom I had counted to revive the images that my tired memory,Swann's Way
7178,"had lost and could not find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I",Swann's Way
7178,"had been playing the day before, and whom I had just been prompted to",Swann's Way
7178,"greet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when",Swann's Way
7178,"we are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time",Swann's Way
7178,"to think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the",Swann's Way
7178,little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people.,Swann's Way
7178,"If, for instance, I had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes",Swann's Way
7178,"above plump and rosy cheeks, Gilberte's face would now offer me (and",Swann's Way
7178,"with emphasis) something that I distinctly had not remembered, a",Swann's Way
7178,"certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously",Swann's Way
7178,"associating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the",Swann's Way
7178,"importance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used",Swann's Way
7178,"to define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind",Swann's Way
7178,that have sharpened profiles. While I was making myself ready to take,Swann's Way
7178,"advantage of this long expected moment, and to surrender myself to the",Swann's Way
7178,impression of Gilberte which I had prepared beforehand but could no,Swann's Way
7178,"longer find in my head, to an extent which would enable me, during the",Swann's Way
7178,"long hours which I must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed",Swann's Way
7178,"herself whom I had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that I",Swann's Way
7178,"was gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it, she",Swann's Way
7178,"threw me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes",Swann's Way
7178,account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect,Swann's Way
7178,"declines to believe, the same self which had made me salute her before I",Swann's Way
7178,had identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me,Swann's Way
7178,"(as though she had been a companion, with whom I had come to play, and",Swann's Way
7178,"not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be united), made me,",Swann's Way
7178,"out of politeness, until the time came when she had to I go, address",Swann's Way
7178,"a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both",Swann's Way
7178,from keeping a silence in which I might at last have laid my hand upon,Swann's Way
7178,"the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might",Swann's Way
7178,have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which I,Swann's Way
7178,"was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. There was,",Swann's Way
7178,"however, an occasional development. One day, we had gone with Gilberte",Swann's Way
7178,"to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly",Swann's Way
7178,"nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send for his",Swann's Way
7178,"gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial",Swann's Way
7178,"eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great",Swann's Way
7178,"quantity,--Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who",Swann's Way
7178,were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's,Swann's Way
7178,storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock because,Swann's Way
7178,"he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes,",Swann's Way
7178,"refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he",Swann's Way
7178,"finally explained in passionate tones: ""I want the other plum; it's got",Swann's Way
7178,"a worm in it!"" I purchased two ha'penny marbles. With admiring eyes I",Swann's Way
7178,"saw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles",Swann's Way
7178,which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as,Swann's Way
7178,"little girls, and because they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was",Swann's Way
7178,"given a great deal more pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I",Swann's Way
7178,"thought the prettiest. They were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as",Swann's Way
7178,life itself. I would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them.,Swann's Way
7178,"I should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all.",Swann's Way
7178,"Still, I pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte",Swann's Way
7178,"took it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it,",Swann's Way
7178,"paid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: ""Take it; it",Swann's Way
7178,"is for you, I give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in",Swann's Way
7178,"classic drama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet",Swann's Way
7178,"in which Bergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She",Swann's Way
7178,"had told me to let her know the exact title of it, and that evening",Swann's Way
7178,"I had sent her a little telegram, writing on its envelope the name,",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte Swann, which I had so often traced in my exercise-books. Next",Swann's Way
7178,day she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white,Swann's Way
7178,"wax, the pamphlet, a copy of which she had managed to find. ""You see, it",Swann's Way
7178,"is what you asked me for,"" she said, taking from her muff the telegram",Swann's Way
7178,"that I had sent her. But in the address on the pneumatic message--which,",Swann's Way
7178,"only yesterday, was nothing, was merely a 'little blue' that I had",Swann's Way
7178,"written, and, after a messenger had delivered it to Gilberte's porter",Swann's Way
7178,"and a servant had taken it to her in her room, had become a thing",Swann's Way
7178,"without value or distinction, one of the 'little blues' that she had",Swann's Way
7178,received in the course of the day--I had difficulty in recognising,Swann's Way
7178,"the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles",Swann's Way
7178,"stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil by",Swann's Way
7178,"a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world,",Swann's Way
7178,"violet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to",Swann's Way
7178,"espouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"And there was another day on which she said to me: ""You know, you may",Swann's Way
7178,"call me 'Gilberte'; in any case, I'm going to call you by your first",Swann's Way
7178,"name. It's too silly not to."" Yet she continued for a while to address",Swann's Way
7178,"me by the more formal '_vous_,' and, when I drew her attention to this,",Swann's Way
7178,"smiled, and composing, constructing a phrase like those that are put",Swann's Way
7178,into the grammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to,Swann's Way
7178,"teach us to make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And",Swann's Way
7178,"when I recalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish",Swann's Way
7178,"the impression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself,",Swann's Way
7178,"naked, without, any longer, any of the social qualifications which",Swann's Way
7178,"belonged equally to her other companions and, when she used my surname,",Swann's Way
7178,"to my parents, accessories of which her lips--by the effort that she",Swann's Way
7178,"made, a little after her father's manner, to articulate the words to",Swann's Way
7178,"which she wished to give a special value--had the air of stripping, of",Swann's Way
7178,"divesting me, as one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going",Swann's Way
7178,"to put only the pulp into one's mouth, while her glance, adapting itself",Swann's Way
7178,"to the same new degree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more",Swann's Way
7178,"directly, not without testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure,",Swann's Way
7178,"even the gratitude that it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of",Swann's Way
7178,"these new pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I",Swann's Way
7178,"loved, to me who loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to",Swann's Way
7178,"play, to my other self, who possessed neither the memory of the true",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value",Swann's Way
7178,of a happiness for which it alone had longed. Even after I had returned,Swann's Way
7178,"home I did not taste them, since, every day, the necessity which made",Swann's Way
7178,"me hope that on the morrow I should arrive at the clear, calm, happy",Swann's Way
7178,"contemplation of Gilberte, that she would at last confess her love",Swann's Way
7178,"for me, explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged,",Swann's Way
7178,"hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity forced me to regard the",Swann's Way
7178,"past as of no account, to look ahead of me only, to consider the little",Swann's Way
7178,advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were,Swann's Way
7178,"self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which I might",Swann's Way
7178,"set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step further and",Swann's Way
7178,finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet encountered.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"If, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled",Swann's Way
7178,"me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often",Swann's Way
7178,on the very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my,Swann's Way
7178,"hopes. I was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elysées, and",Swann's Way
7178,I felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great,Swann's Way
7178,happiness when--going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss,Swann's Way
7178,"Mamma, who was already dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair",Swann's Way
7178,"elaborately built up, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant",Swann's Way
7178,"still with soap--I had been apprised, by seeing a column of dust",Swann's Way
7178,"standing by itself in the air above the piano, and by hearing a",Swann's Way
7178,"barrel-organ playing, beneath the window, _En revenant de la revue_,",Swann's Way
7178,"that the winter had received, until nightfall, an unexpected, radiant",Swann's Way
7178,"visit from a day of spring. While we sat at luncheon, by opening her",Swann's Way
7178,"window, the lady opposite had sent packing, in the twinkling of an eye,",Swann's Way
7178,from beside my chair--to sweep in a single stride over the whole width,Swann's Way
7178,of our dining-room--a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday,Swann's Way
7178,"rest and returned to continue it there a moment later. At school, during",Swann's Way
7178,"the one o'clock lesson, the sun made me sick with impatience and boredom",Swann's Way
7178,"as it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge of my desk, like",Swann's Way
7178,an invitation to the feast at which I could not myself arrive before,Swann's Way
7178,"three o'clock, until the moment when Françoise came to fetch me at the",Swann's Way
7178,"school-gate, and we made our way towards the Champs-Elysées through",Swann's Way
7178,"streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people, over which the",Swann's Way
7178,"balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to float in",Swann's Way
7178,front of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the Champs-Elysées,Swann's Way
7178,"I found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless, on the lawn",Swann's Way
7178,"nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled to a flame",Swann's Way
7178,"the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon",Swann's Way
7178,it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick,Swann's Way
7178,"had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with my eyes fixed",Swann's Way
7178,"on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the form of",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which",Swann's Way
7178,"glistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the",Swann's Way
7178,"sun. The old lady who read the Débats was sitting on her chair, in her",Swann's Way
7178,"invariable place, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly",Swann's Way
7178,"wave of her hands towards him as she exclaimed ""What a lovely day!"" And",Swann's Way
7178,"when the chair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of",Swann's Way
7178,"smirks and affectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove,",Swann's Way
7178,"as though it had been a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in",Swann's Way
7178,"gratitude to the donor, the most becoming place upon her person. When",Swann's Way
7178,"she had found it, she performed a circular movement with her neck,",Swann's Way
7178,"straightened her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed",Swann's Way
7178,"her the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist, the",Swann's Way
7178,"bewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man, pointing to her",Swann's Way
7178,"bosom: ""You see, I'm wearing your roses!""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I dragged Françoise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc",Swann's Way
7178,"de Triomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn",Swann's Way
7178,"convinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden",Swann's Way
7178,"horses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me:",Swann's Way
7178,"""Quick, quick, Gilberte's been here a quarter of an hour. She's just",Swann's Way
7178,"going. We've been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner's base.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"While I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Gilberte had",Swann's Way
7178,"arrived by the Rue Boissy-d'Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage",Swann's Way
7178,of the fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was,Swann's Way
7178,coming to fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to,Swann's Way
7178,have strayed from the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what,Swann's Way
7178,"direction Gilberte would appear, whether she would be early or late, and",Swann's Way
7178,this perpetual tension succeeded in making more impressive not only the,Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées in their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon,",Swann's Way
7178,"like a vast expanse of space and time, on every point and at every",Swann's Way
7178,"moment of which it was possible that the form of Gilberte might appear,",Swann's Way
7178,"but also that form itself, since behind its appearance I felt that there",Swann's Way
7178,lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart,Swann's Way
7178,"at four o'clock instead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat,",Swann's Way
7178,"for paying calls, instead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the",Swann's Way
7178,Ambassadeurs and not between the two puppet-shows; I divined one of,Swann's Way
7178,"those occupations in which I might not follow Gilberte, occupations",Swann's Way
7178,"that forced her to go out or to stay at home, I was in contact with the",Swann's Way
7178,"mystery of her unknown life. It was this mystery, too, which troubled",Swann's Way
7178,"me when, running at the sharp-voiced girl's bidding, so as to begin our",Swann's Way
7178,"game without more delay, I saw Gilberte, so quick and informal with",Swann's Way
7178,"us, make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the _Débats_ (who",Swann's Way
7178,"acknowledged it with ""What a lovely sun! You'd think there was a fire",Swann's Way
7178,"burning."") speaking to her with a shy smile, with an air of constraint",Swann's Way
7178,which called to my mind the other little girl that Gilberte must be when,Swann's Way
7178,"at home with her parents, or with friends of her parents, paying",Swann's Way
7178,"visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her existence. But of that",Swann's Way
7178,"existence no one gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who",Swann's Way
7178,came a little later to fetch his daughter. That was because he and Mme.,Swann's Way
7178,"Swann--inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as her lessons,",Swann's Way
7178,"her games, her friendships depended upon them--contained for me, like",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects that had",Swann's Way
7178,"an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source, an",Swann's Way
7178,"undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm. Everything that",Swann's Way
7178,concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation,Swann's Way
7178,"that the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had seen so",Swann's Way
7178,"often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he",Swann's Way
7178,was still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the,Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited",Swann's Way
7178,"by the appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the",Swann's Way
7178,"sight of him still impressed me as might that of an historic personage,",Swann's Way
7178,"upon whom one had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest",Swann's Way
7178,details of whose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with,Swann's Way
7178,"the Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray,",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to me unimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous,",Swann's Way
7178,as if no one else had ever known the House of Orleans; they set him,Swann's Way
7178,in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians,Swann's Way
7178,"of different classes, who encumbered that particular path in the",Swann's Way
7178,"Champs-Elysées, in the midst of whom I admired his condescending to",Swann's Way
7178,"figure without claiming any special deference, which as it happened none",Swann's Way
7178,"of them dreamed of paying him, so profound was the incognito in which he",Swann's Way
7178,was wrapped.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"He responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte's companions, even",Swann's Way
7178,"to mine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family,",Swann's Way
7178,but without appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had,Swann's Way
7178,"constantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but",Swann's Way
7178,"kept out of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had",Swann's Way
7178,"become to me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann;",Swann's Way
7178,"as the ideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different",Swann's Way
7178,"from the ideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which",Swann's Way
7178,"I utilised not at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had",Swann's Way
7178,"become a new, another person; still I attached him by an artificial",Swann's Way
7178,"thread, secondary and transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing",Swann's Way
7178,had any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love,Swann's Way
7178,"might profit by it, it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not",Swann's Way
7178,being able to erase them from my memory that I recaptured the years in,Swann's Way
7178,"which, in the eyes of this same Swann who was at this moment before me",Swann's Way
7178,"in the Champs-Elysées, and to whom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps",Swann's Way
7178,"not mentioned my name, I had so often, in the evenings, made myself",Swann's Way
7178,ridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to come upstairs to my room to say,Swann's Way
7178,"good-night to me, while she was drinking coffee with him and my father",Swann's Way
7178,and my grandparents at the table in the garden.) He told Gilberte that,Swann's Way
7178,"she might play one game; he could wait for a quarter of an hour; and,",Swann's Way
7178,"sitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron chair, paid for his",Swann's Way
7178,"ticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often held in his own,",Swann's Way
7178,"while we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the pigeons, whose",Swann's Way
7178,"beautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and, surely, the lilacs",Swann's Way
7178,"of the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many sanctuaries, one on",Swann's Way
7178,"the great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it disappeared below the",Swann's Way
7178,"rim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of offering to the bird in",Swann's Way
7178,"abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared to be pecking, another",Swann's Way

7178,"the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which, when the goddess",Swann's Way

7178,"there, too, everything's got out of order.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way

7178,"given utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a",Swann's Way
7178,"long time, to the Champs-Elysées. But already the charm with which, by",Swann's Way
7178,"the mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of",Swann's Way
7178,"her, the privileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which",Swann's Way
7178,I was inevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a,Swann's Way
7178,"scar in my mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference",Swann's Way
7178,"something romantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape",Swann's Way
7178,themselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And,Swann's Way
7178,"when the time came for the postman I said to myself, that evening as on",Swann's Way
7178,"every other: ""I am going to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to",Swann's Way
7178,"tell me, at last, that she has never ceased to love me, and to explain",Swann's Way
7178,to me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her,Swann's Way
7178,"love from me until now, to put on the appearance of being able to be",Swann's Way
7178,happy without seeing me; the reason for which she has assumed the form,Swann's Way
7178,"of the other Gilberte, who is simply a companion.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"Every evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter,",Swann's Way
7178,"believing that I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences",Swann's Way
7178,"in turn. Suddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was",Swann's Way
7178,"to receive a letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this",Swann's Way
7178,"letter, since it was I myself who had just composed it. And from that",Swann's Way
7178,moment I would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I,Swann's Way
7178,"should have liked her to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting",Swann's Way
7178,"them myself, I should be excluding just those identical words,--the",Swann's Way
7178,"dearest, the most desired--from the field of possible events. Even if,",Swann's Way
7178,"by an almost impossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter",Swann's Way
7178,"of my invention that Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord,",Swann's Way
7178,recognising my own work in it I should not have had the impression that,Swann's Way
7178,"I was receiving something that had not originated in myself, something",Swann's Way
7178,"real, something new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my",Swann's Way
7178,"will, a gift indeed from love.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been",Swann's Way
7178,"written to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that",Swann's Way
7178,page by Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine,Swann's Way
7178,"drew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within",Swann's Way
7178,reach. I was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book,Swann's Way
7178,"for me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion,",Swann's Way
7178,so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves,Swann's Way
7178,qualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are,Swann's Way
7178,"worthy to excite a man's love, that he assimilates them by imitation",Swann's Way
7178,"and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these",Swann's Way
7178,qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would,Swann's Way
7178,"have sought, so long as it was spontaneous--as Swann, before my day, had",Swann's Way
7178,"sought to establish the aesthetic basis of Odette's beauty--I, who had",Swann's Way
7178,"at first loved Gilberte, in Combray days, on account of all the unknown",Swann's Way
7178,"element in her life into which I would fain have plunged headlong, have",Swann's Way
7178,"undergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing",Swann's Way
7178,"that no longer mattered, I thought now, as of an inestimable advantage,",Swann's Way
7178,"that of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the",Swann's Way
7178,"comforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work,",Swann's Way
7178,"would collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that",Swann's Way
7178,"infinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom I had first,",Swann's Way
7178,"before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte, now it was for Gilberte's",Swann's Way
7178,"sake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages that",Swann's Way
7178,"he had written about Racine, I studied the wrapper, folded under great",Swann's Way
7178,"seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she",Swann's Way
7178,"had brought those pages to me. I kissed the agate marble, which was",Swann's Way
7178,"the better part of my love's heart, the part that was not frivolous but",Swann's Way
7178,"faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte's life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my",Swann's Way
7178,"bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages",Swann's Way
7178,of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of my love for,Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have",Swann's Way
7178,"any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I perceived,",Swann's Way
7178,"anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements",Swann's Way
7178,"had been determined by the writer's talent, or by geological laws,",Swann's Way
7178,"before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have",Swann's Way
7178,"been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing,",Swann's Way
7178,"consequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness.",Swann's Way
7178,"And while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a",Swann's Way
7178,"confession of Gilberte's love for me, destroyed, unravelled every",Swann's Way
7178,"evening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being",Swann's Way
7178,was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed,Swann's Way
7178,"threads, but collected and rearranged them, without any thought of",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order",Swann's Way
7178,which she gave to all her handiwork. Without any special interest in my,Swann's Way
7178,"love, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she placed, side by",Swann's Way
7178,"side, those of Gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and",Swann's Way
7178,"her faults which I had excused. Then, one with another, they took on",Swann's Way
7178,"a meaning. It seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when I saw",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, instead of coming to me in the Champs-Elysées, going to a",Swann's Way
7178,"party, or on errands with her governess, when I saw her prepared for",Swann's Way
7178,"an absence that would extend over the New Year holidays, I was wrong in",Swann's Way
7178,"thinking, in saying: ""It is because she is frivolous,"" or ""easily lead.""",Swann's Way
7178,"For she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she",Swann's Way
7178,had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in,Swann's Way
7178,her heart that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It shewed me,Swann's Way
7178,"further, this new arrangement, that I ought, after all, to know what",Swann's Way
7178,"it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it drew my attention to the",Swann's Way
7178,"constant anxiety that I had to 'shew off' before her, by reason of which",Swann's Way
7178,I tried to persuade my mother to get for Françoise a waterproof coat and,Swann's Way
7178,"a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to",Swann's Way
7178,the Champs-Elysées an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen (to all,Swann's Way
7178,"of which my mother replied that I was not fair to Françoise, that",Swann's Way
7178,"she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole,",Swann's Way
7178,"exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that, months in",Swann's Way
7178,"advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she",Swann's Way
7178,"would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the most",Swann's Way
7178,attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she,Swann's Way
7178,"were not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever",Swann's Way
7178,"in Paris, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysées; and it had",Swann's Way
7178,little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my,Swann's Way
7178,"need could be justified by anything in Gilberte's conduct. She, on the",Swann's Way
7178,"contrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself",Swann's Way
7178,over what I might choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to,Swann's Way
7178,her not to come to the Champs-Elysées if she had to go shopping with,Swann's Way
7178,"Mademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother.",Swann's Way
7178,And even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my,Swann's Way
7178,"holidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing",Swann's Way
7178,"that place she considered her parents' wishes, a thousand different",Swann's Way
7178,"amusements of which she had been told, and not at all that it should be",Swann's Way
7178,the place to which my family were proposing to send me. When she assured,Swann's Way
7178,me (as sometimes happened) that she liked me less than some other of,Swann's Way
7178,"her friends, less than she had liked me the day before, because by my",Swann's Way
7178,"clumsiness I had made her side lose a game, I would beg her pardon, I",Swann's Way
7178,would beg her to tell me what I must do in order that she should begin,Swann's Way
7178,"again to like me as much as, or more than the rest; I hoped to hear her",Swann's Way
7178,say that that was already my position; I besought her; as though she had,Swann's Way
7178,"been able to modify her affection for me as she or I chose, to give me",Swann's Way
7178,"pleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as my good or bad",Swann's Way
7178,"conduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt,",Swann's Way
7178,"myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"It shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver,",Swann's Way
7178,"that, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has",Swann's Way
7178,"hitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed",Swann's Way
7178,"in their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a",Swann's Way
7178,"light to which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what",Swann's Way
7178,will be that person's actions on the morrow.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"These new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it",Swann's Way
7178,that the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone,Swann's Way
7178,"before; that Gilberte's feeling for me, too long established now to",Swann's Way
7178,"be capable of alteration, was indifference; that in my friendship with",Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte, it was I alone who loved. ""That is true,"" my love responded,",Swann's Way
7178,"""there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter",Swann's Way
7178,"now."" And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public",Swann's Way
7178,"holiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year,",Swann's Way
7178,"perhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time",Swann's Way
7178,"starts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its",Swann's Way
7178,legacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and,Swann's Way
7178,to join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.,Swann's Way

7178,"I had always, within reach, a plan of Paris, which, because I could see",Swann's Way
7178,"drawn on it the street in which M. and Mme. Swann lived, seemed to me to",Swann's Way
7178,"contain a secret treasure. And to please myself, as well as by a sort",Swann's Way
7178,"of chivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, I",Swann's Way
7178,"would repeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like",Swann's Way
7178,"my mother and grandmother, in the secret of my love, would ask: ""But",Swann's Way
7178,why are you always talking about that street? There's nothing wonderful,Swann's Way
7178,about it. It is an admirable street to live in because it's only a few,Swann's Way
7178,"minutes' walk from the Bois, but there are a dozen other streets just",Swann's Way
7178,"the same.""",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,I made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation,Swann's Way
7178,"with my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it;",Swann's Way
7178,"but I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself",Swann's Way
7178,"play that chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice",Swann's Way
7178,"me. Moreover, that name of Swann, with which I had for so long been",Swann's Way
7178,"familiar, was to me now (as happens at times to people suffering from",Swann's Way
7178,"aphasia, in the case of the most ordinary words) the name of something",Swann's Way
7178,"new. It was for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow",Swann's Way
7178,"accustomed to it. I analysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me",Swann's Way
7178,as a surprise. And with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its,Swann's Way
7178,innocence. The pleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to,Swann's Way
7178,"be so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my",Swann's Way
7178,"thoughts, and would change the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it",Swann's Way
7178,in that direction. I fell back upon subjects which still brought me into,Swann's Way
7178,"touch with Gilberte, I eternally repeated the same words, and it was no",Swann's Way
7178,"use my knowing that they were but words--words uttered in her absence,",Swann's Way
7178,"which she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating",Swann's Way
7178,"what were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them--for still",Swann's Way
7178,"it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way",Swann's Way
7178,"everything that had reference to Gilberte, I might perhaps make emerge",Swann's Way
7178,from it something that would bring me happiness. I told my parents again,Swann's Way
7178,"that Gilberte was very fond of her governess, as if the statement, when",Swann's Way

7178,"becoming quite impossible."" More than all else I should have liked to",Swann's Way
7178,be as bald as Swann. He appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary,Swann's Way

7178,"saw knew him also, and that in the course of the day anyone might run",Swann's Way

7178,"stockbroker, topics as which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure.",Swann's Way
7178,My imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a,Swann's Way
7178,"certain family, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a",Swann's Way
7178,"certain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its",Swann's Way
7178,windows precious. But these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as,Swann's Way
7178,my father and mother looked upon the house in which Swann lived as one,Swann's Way
7178,that closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the,Swann's Way
7178,"neighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann's family seemed to them to be in the",Swann's Way
7178,same category as many other families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was,Swann's Way
7178,more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in,Swann's Way
7178,"question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe,",Swann's Way
7178,"and there was about it nothing that they could call unique. What, on the",Swann's Way
7178,"other hand, they did appreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if",Swann's Way
7178,"not in greater measure elsewhere. And so, after admitting that the house",Swann's Way
7178,"was in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house",Swann's Way
7178,"that was in a better, but had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of",Swann's Way
7178,financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they,Swann's Way
7178,"had appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake",Swann's Way
7178,which was very soon corrected. For in order to distinguish in all,Swann's Way
7178,"Gilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale",Swann's Way
7178,"of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a",Swann's Way
7178,"supplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the",Swann's Way
7178,"time being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked.",Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,On the days when Gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to,Swann's Way
7178,"the Champs-Elysées, I would try to arrange my walks so that I should",Swann's Way
7178,be brought into some kind of contact with her. Sometimes I would lead,Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the Swanns lived, making",Swann's Way
7178,her repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess,Swann's Way
7178,"with regard to Mme. Swann. ""It seems, she puts great faith in medals.",Swann's Way
7178,She would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an,Swann's Way
7178,"owl hoot, or the death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat",Swann's Way
7178,"at midnight, or if the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she's a most",Swann's Way
7178,"religious lady, she is!"" I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if,",Swann's Way
7178,"on our way, I caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my",Swann's Way
7178,"emotion would bring me to a standstill, I would fasten on his white",Swann's Way
7178,whiskers eyes that melted with passion. And Françoise would rouse me,Swann's Way
7178,"with: ""What's wrong with you now, child?"" and we would continue on our",Swann's Way
7178,"way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every",Swann's Way
7178,"other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his",Swann's Way
7178,"livery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt to be latent in",Swann's Way
7178,"the name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that I was one",Swann's Way
7178,of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from,Swann's Way
7178,"penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty",Swann's Way
7178,"to guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of",Swann's Way
7178,"being protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly",Swann's Way
7178,"sweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the",Swann's Way
7178,world than to Gilberte's glancing eyes. On other days we would go along,Swann's Way
7178,"the boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue Duphot;",Swann's Way
7178,"I had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way",Swann's Way
7178,to the dentist's; and my imagination so far differentiated Gilberte's,Swann's Way
7178,"father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd",Swann's Way
7178,"of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even",Swann's Way
7178,before we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at,Swann's Way
7178,the thought that I was approaching a street from which that supernatural,Swann's Way
7178,apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"But most often of all, on days when I was not to see Gilberte, as I",Swann's Way
7178,had heard that Mme. Swann walked almost every day along the Allée des,Swann's Way
7178,"Acacias, round the big lake, and in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I",Swann's Way
7178,would guide Françoise in the direction of the Bois de Boulogne. It was,Swann's Way
7178,to me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled,Swann's Way
7178,"together a variety of flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where",Swann's Way
7178,"from a hill one passes to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench,",Swann's Way
7178,"another hill, a marsh, but knows that they are there only to enable",Swann's Way
7178,"the hippopotamus, zebra, crocodile, rabbit, bear and heron to disport",Swann's Way
7178,"themselves in a natural or a picturesque setting; this, the Bois,",Swann's Way
7178,"equally complex, uniting a multitude of little worlds, distinct and",Swann's Way
7178,"separate--placing a stage set with red trees, American oaks, like an",Swann's Way
7178,"experimental forest in Virginia, next to a fir-wood by the edge of the",Swann's Way
7178,"lake, or to a forest grove from which would suddenly emerge, in her",Swann's Way
7178,"lissom covering of furs, with the large, appealing eyes of a dumb",Swann's Way
7178,"animal, a hastening walker--was the Garden of Woman; and like the",Swann's Way
7178,"myrtle-alley in the Aeneid, planted for their delight with trees of one",Swann's Way
7178,"kind only, the Allée des Acacias was thronged by the famous Beauties",Swann's Way
7178,"of the day. As, from a long way off, the sight of the jutting crag from",Swann's Way
7178,which it dives into the pool thrills with joy the children who know,Swann's Way
7178,"that they are going to behold the seal, long before I reached the",Swann's Way
7178,"acacia-alley, their fragrance, scattered abroad, would make me feel that",Swann's Way
7178,"I was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable personality,",Swann's Way
7178,"strong and tender; then, as I drew near, the sight of their topmost",Swann's Way
7178,"branches, their lightly tossing foliage, in its easy grace, its",Swann's Way
7178,"coquettish outline, its delicate fabric, over which hundreds of flowers",Swann's Way
7178,"were laid, like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects; and",Swann's Way
7178,"finally their name itself, feminine, indolent and seductive, made my",Swann's Way
7178,"heart beat, but with a social longing, like those waltzes which remind",Swann's Way
7178,"us only of the names of the fair dancers, called aloud as they entered",Swann's Way
7178,the ball-room. I had been told that I should see in the alley certain,Swann's Way
7178,"women of fashion, who, in spite of their not all having husbands, were",Swann's Way
7178,"constantly mentioned in conjunction with Mme. Swann, but most often by",Swann's Way
7178,"their professional names;--their new names, when they had any, being",Swann's Way
7178,"but a sort of incognito, a veil which those who would speak of them were",Swann's Way
7178,"careful to draw aside, so as to make themselves understood. Thinking",Swann's Way
7178,that Beauty--in the order of feminine elegance--was governed by occult,Swann's Way
7178,"laws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they",Swann's Way
7178,"had the power to realise it, I accepted before seeing them, like the",Swann's Way
7178,"truth of a coming revelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their",Swann's Way
7178,"carriages and horses, of a thousand details among which I placed my",Swann's Way
7178,faith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to,Swann's Way
7178,that ephemeral and changing pageant. But it was Mme. Swann whom I wished,Swann's Way
7178,"to see, and I waited for her to go past, as deeply moved as though",Swann's Way
7178,"she were Gilberte, whose parents, saturated, like everything in her",Swann's Way
7178,"environment, with her own special charm, excited in me as keen a passion",Swann's Way
7178,"as she did herself, indeed a still more painful disturbance (since their",Swann's Way
7178,"point of contact with her was that intimate, that internal part of",Swann's Way
7178,"her life which was hidden from me), and furthermore, for I very soon",Swann's Way
7178,"learned, as we shall see in due course, that they did not like my",Swann's Way
7178,"playing with her, that feeling of veneration which we always have for",Swann's Way
7178,"those who hold, and exercise without restraint, the power to do us an",Swann's Way
7178,injury.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of",Swann's Way
7178,"social grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a",Swann's Way
7178,"'polonaise' of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a",Swann's Way
7178,"pheasant's wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the",Swann's Way
7178,Allée des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her,Swann's Way
7178,"own house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the",Swann's Way
7178,"gentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were",Swann's Way
7178,raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never,Swann's Way
7178,anyone so well turned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to,Swann's Way
7178,"ostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled",Swann's Way
7178,"Françoise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs",Swann's Way
7178,"were 'giving' beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another",Swann's Way
7178,"hour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for",Swann's Way
7178,"me a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as",Swann's Way
7178,"no real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of",Swann's Way
7178,"their power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience--borne",Swann's Way
7178,"along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as",Swann's Way
7178,"one sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an",Swann's Way
7178,"enormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive",Swann's Way
7178,"groom, like Toby, ""the late Beaudenord's tiger,"" I saw--or rather I",Swann's Way
7178,felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab--a,Swann's Way
7178,"matchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme",Swann's Way
7178,"modernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down",Swann's Way
7178,"in which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with",Swann's Way
7178,"one grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from",Swann's Way
7178,"which floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips",Swann's Way
7178,an ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension,Swann's Way
7178,"of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the",Swann's Way
7178,"courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her.",Swann's Way
7178,"That smile was, in reality, saying to one: ""Oh yes, I do remember, quite",Swann's Way
7178,"well; it was wonderful!"" to another: ""How I should have loved to! We",Swann's Way
7178,"were unfortunate!"", to a third: ""Yes, if you like! I must just keep in",Swann's Way
7178,"the line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will break away."" When",Swann's Way
7178,strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy,Swann's Way
7178,"smile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which made them",Swann's Way
7178,"say: ""What a lovely woman!"". And for certain men only she had a sour,",Swann's Way
7178,"strained, shy, cold smile which meant: ""Yes, you old goat, I know",Swann's Way
7178,"that you've got a tongue like a viper, that you can't keep quiet for a",Swann's Way
7178,"moment. But do you suppose that I care what you say?"" Coquelin passed,",Swann's Way
7178,"talking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of",Swann's Way
7178,his hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But,Swann's Way
7178,"I thought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her,",Swann's Way
7178,"for I knew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would",Swann's Way
7178,"tell her coachman to 'break away' and to stop the carriage, so that she",Swann's Way
7178,might come back on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage,Swann's Way
7178,to pass close by her I would drag Françoise off in that direction; until,Swann's Way
7178,"the moment came when I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long",Swann's Way
7178,"train of her lilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be",Swann's Way
7178,"dressed, in rich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering",Swann's Way
7178,"her eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant",Swann's Way
7178,"attention to the passers-by, as though the important thing for her, her",Swann's Way
7178,"one object in being there, was to take exercise, without thinking that",Swann's Way
7178,"she was seen, and that every head was turned towards her. Sometimes,",Swann's Way
7178,"however, when she had looked back to call her dog to her, she would",Swann's Way

7178,"Those even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional,",Swann's Way

7178,"ampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter,",Swann's Way
7178,"had that very morning all 'come out,' so to speak, in blossom. And the",Swann's Way
7178,"Bois had the temporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden",Swann's Way
7178,"or a park in which, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation",Swann's Way
7178,"for a festival, there have been embedded among the trees of commoner",Swann's Way
7178,"growth, which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a",Swann's Way
7178,"few rare specimens, with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing",Swann's Way
7178,"all round themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing",Swann's Way
7178,light. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne,Swann's Way
7178,"displays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct elements",Swann's Way
7178,in a composite whole than at any other. It was also the time of day.,Swann's Way
7178,"In places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to have",Swann's Way
7178,undergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they,Swann's Way
7178,"were touched by the sun's light, still, at this hour in the morning,",Swann's Way
7178,"almost horizontal, as it would be again, a few hours later, at the",Swann's Way
7178,"moment when, just as dusk began, it would flame up like a lamp, project",Swann's Way
7178,"afar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow, and set ablaze the few",Swann's Way
7178,"topmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre",Swann's Way
7178,incombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the,Swann's Way
7178,"light grew solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian",Swann's Way
7178,"masonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of",Swann's Way
7178,"the chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which",Swann's Way
7178,"they stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the trunk",Swann's Way
7178,"of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and brought to",Swann's Way
7178,"blossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished, an enormous posy,",Swann's Way
7178,"of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of carnation. The",Swann's Way
7178,"different parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in summer in the",Swann's Way
7178,"density and monotony of their universal green, were now clearly divided.",Swann's Way
7178,A patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of,Swann's Way
7178,"them, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an",Swann's Way
7178,"oriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville, the",Swann's Way
7178,"Pré Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here and",Swann's Way
7178,"there would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for",Swann's Way
7178,"which the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne",Swann's Way
7178,upon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the,Swann's Way
7178,"Bois was not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the",Swann's Way
7178,life of its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration,Swann's Way
7178,of the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which,Swann's Way
7178,"the heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause, without",Swann's Way
7178,understanding that it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed,Swann's Way
7178,"at the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and,",Swann's Way
7178,"without my knowledge, directed itself towards that masterpiece of",Swann's Way
7178,beautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every,Swann's Way
7178,day. I walked towards the Allée des Acacias. I passed through forest,Swann's Way
7178,"groves in which the morning light, breaking them into new sections,",Swann's Way
7178,"lopped and trimmed the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made",Swann's Way
7178,nosegays of their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of,Swann's Way
7178,"trees; making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would",Swann's Way
7178,"cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and, weaving",Swann's Way
7178,"together the two halves that remained, would make of them either a",Swann's Way
7178,"single pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light, or a single",Swann's Way
7178,"luminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour was encompassed",Swann's Way
7178,in a network of inky shadows. When a ray of sunshine gilded the highest,Swann's Way
7178,"branches, they seemed, soaked and still dripping with a sparkling",Swann's Way
7178,"moisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid, emerald-green",Swann's Way
7178,atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the,Swann's Way
7178,"sea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality, and when",Swann's Way
7178,"they had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more brightly still",Swann's Way
7178,"from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or in the white",Swann's Way
7178,enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to,Swann's Way
7178,"the topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in",Swann's Way
7178,"Michelangelo's 'Creation.' But, forced for so many years now, by a sort",Swann's Way
7178,"of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they called",Swann's Way
7178,"to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly walking,",Swann's Way
7178,"brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as she",Swann's Way
7178,"passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves",Swann's Way
7178,"acknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy",Swann's Way
7178,"days when I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the",Swann's Way
7178,spots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few,Swann's Way
7178,"moments beneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty",Swann's Way
7178,"for which the firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long,",Swann's Way
7178,more disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of,Swann's Way
7178,"Trianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself",Swann's Way
7178,"in the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a little",Swann's Way
7178,temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves,Swann's Way
7178,ribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as,Swann's Way
7178,the pigeon-shooting ground. The idea of perfection which I had within me,Swann's Way
7178,"I had bestowed, in that other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the raking thinness of those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon",Swann's Way
7178,"the wing, with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which",Swann's Way
7178,"now, smitten by a desire to see again what I had once loved, as ardent",Swann's Way
7178,"as the desire that had driven me, many years before, along the same",Swann's Way
7178,"paths, I wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme.",Swann's Way
7178,"Swann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his",Swann's Way
7178,"fist, and as infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to",Swann's Way
7178,"curb the ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they",Swann's Way
7178,thundered along the ground. Alas! there was nothing now but motor-cars,Swann's Way
7178,"driven each by a moustached mechanic, with a tall footman towering by",Swann's Way
7178,"his side. I wished to hold before my bodily eyes, that I might know",Swann's Way
7178,whether they were indeed as charming as they appeared to the eyes of,Swann's Way
7178,"memory, little hats, so low-crowned as to seem no more than garlands",Swann's Way
7178,about the brows of women. All the hats now were immense; covered with,Swann's Way
7178,fruits and flowers and all manner of birds. In place of the lovely gowns,Swann's Way
7178,"in which Mme. Swann walked like a Queen, appeared Greco-Saxon tunics,",Swann's Way
7178,"with Tanagra folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire style, 'Liberty",Swann's Way
7178,chiffons' sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper. On the heads,Swann's Way
7178,of the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with Mme. Swann,Swann's Way
7178,"in the Allée de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey 'tile' hats",Swann's Way
7178,"of old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois bare-headed. And seeing",Swann's Way
7178,"all these new elements of the spectacle, I had no longer the faith",Swann's Way
7178,"which, applied to them, would have given them consistency, unity,",Swann's Way
7178,"life; they passed in a scattered sequence before me, at random, without",Swann's Way
7178,"reality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have",Swann's Way
7178,"endeavoured as in the old days, to extract from them and to compose in",Swann's Way
7178,"a picture. They were just women, in whose elegance I had no belief,",Swann's Way
7178,"and whose clothes seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes,",Swann's Way
7178,"there survives it--more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence",Swann's Way
7178,"of the power, now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena--an",Swann's Way
7178,idolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did,Swann's Way
7178,"once animate, as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the",Swann's Way
7178,"divine spark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a contingent",Swann's Way
7178,cause--the death of the gods.,Swann's Way
7178,,Swann's Way
7178,"""Oh, horrible!"" I exclaimed to myself: ""Does anyone really imagine that",Swann's Way
7178,these motor-cars are as smart as the old carriage-and-pair? I dare say.,Swann's Way
7178,I am too old now--but I was not intended for a world in which women,Swann's Way
7178,shackle themselves in garments that are not even made of cloth. To what,Swann's Way
7178,purpose shall I walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of,Swann's Way
7178,the assembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening,Swann's Way
7178,"leaves, if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing",Swann's Way
7178,"that once their branches framed? Oh, horrible! My consolation is to",Swann's Way
7178,"think of the women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is",Swann's Way
7178,no standard left of elegance. But how can the people who watch these,Swann's Way
7178,"dreadful creatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped",Swann's Way
7178,"the spoils of aviary or garden-bed,--how can they imagine the charm that",Swann's Way
7178,"there was in the sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac",Swann's Way
7178,"bonnet, or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a",Swann's Way
7178,"single iris?"" Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that",Swann's Way
7178,"I used to feel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an",Swann's Way
7178,"otter-skin coat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like",Swann's Way
7178,"partridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial",Swann's Way
7178,"warmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the",Swann's Way
7178,"bunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue",Swann's Way
7178,"against the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same",Swann's Way
7178,"charming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting,",Swann's Way
7178,"and of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this",Swann's Way
7178,"woman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the",Swann's Way
7178,"blazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked",Swann's Way
7178,out through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have,Swann's Way
7178,sufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as,Swann's Way
7178,in those distant years. Because of the solidarity that binds together,Swann's Way
7178,"the different parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps",Swann's Way
7178,"in a balanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to",Swann's Way
7178,"decline any fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest",Swann's Way
7178,"of the day with one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house",Swann's Way
7178,with dark-painted walls (as Mme. Swann's were still in the year after,Swann's Way
7178,that in which the first part of this story ends) against which would,Swann's Way
7178,"glow the orange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering",Swann's Way
7178,"of her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments",Swann's Way
7178,similar to those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to,Swann's Way
7178,"discover the pleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led",Swann's Way
7178,"to nothing, those moments struck me as having been charming enough in",Swann's Way
7178,themselves. I sought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas!,Swann's Way
7178,"there was nothing now but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all",Swann's Way
7178,"white paint, with hortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not",Swann's Way
7178,"return to Paris, now, until much later. Mme. Swann would have written to",Swann's Way
7178,"me, from a country house, that she would not be in town before February,",Swann's Way
7178,had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which,Swann's Way
7178,"I felt to belong to a distant era, to a date in time towards which it",Swann's Way
7178,"was forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope, the elements of that",Swann's Way
7178,"longing which had become, itself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that",Swann's Way
7178,it had once vainly pursued. And I should have required also that they,Swann's Way
7178,"be the same women, those whose costume interested me because, at a time",Swann's Way
7178,"when I still had faith, my imagination had individualised them and had",Swann's Way
7178,provided each of them with a legend. Alas! in the acacia-avenue--the,Swann's Way
7178,"myrtle-alley--I did see some of them again, grown old, no more now",Swann's Way
7178,"than grim spectres of what once they had been, wandering to and fro, in",Swann's Way
7178,"desperate search of heaven knew what, through the Virgilian groves. They",Swann's Way
7178,"had long fled, and still I stood vainly questioning the deserted paths.",Swann's Way
7178,"The sun's face was hidden. Nature began again to reign over the Bois,",Swann's Way
7178,from which had vanished all trace of the idea that it was the Elysian,Swann's Way
7178,Garden of Woman; above the gimcrack windmill the real sky was grey; the,Swann's Way
7178,"wind wrinkled the surface of the Grand Lac in little wavelets, like",Swann's Way
7178,"a real lake; large birds passed swiftly over the Bois, as over a real",Swann's Way
7178,"wood, and with shrill cries perched, one after another, on the great",Swann's Way
7178,"oaks which, beneath their Druidical crown, and with Dodonaic majesty,",Swann's Way
7178,"seemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this estranged forest, and",Swann's Way
7178,helped me to understand how paradoxical it is to seek in reality for the,Swann's Way
7178,"pictures that are stored in one's memory, which must inevitably lose",Swann's Way
7178,the charm that comes to them from memory itself and from their not,Swann's Way
7178,being apprehended by the senses. The reality that I had known no longer,Swann's Way
7178,"existed. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in the same attire",Swann's Way
7178,"and at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be altered. The places",Swann's Way
7178,that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which,Swann's Way
7178,we map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a,Swann's Way
7178,"thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our",Swann's Way
7178,life at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a,Swann's Way
7178,"particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as",Swann's Way
7178,the years.,Swann's Way
