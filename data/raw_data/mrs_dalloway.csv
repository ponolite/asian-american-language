63107,,Swann's Way
63107,Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the gloves herself.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,Big Ben was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was eleven,Swann's Way
63107,o'clock and the unused hour was fresh as if issued to children on a,Swann's Way
63107,beach. But there was something solemn in the deliberate swing of the,Swann's Way
63107,repeated strokes; something stirring in the murmur of wheels and the,Swann's Way
63107,shuffle of footsteps.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,No doubt they were not all bound on errands of happiness. There is much,Swann's Way
63107,more to be said about us than that we walk the streets of Westminster.,Swann's Way
63107,Big Ben too is nothing but steel rods consumed by rust were it not for,Swann's Way
63107,the care of H. M.'s Office of Works. Only for Mrs Dalloway the moment,Swann's Way
63107,was complete; for Mrs Dalloway June was fresh. A happy childhood--and it,Swann's Way
63107,was not to his daughters only that Justin Parry had seemed a fine fellow,Swann's Way
63107,"(weak of course on the Bench); flowers at evening, smoke rising; the caw",Swann's Way
63107,"of rooks falling from ever so high, down down through the October",Swann's Way
63107,air--there is nothing to take the place of childhood. A leaf of mint,Swann's Way
63107,brings it back; or a cup with a blue ring.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"Poor little wretches, she sighed, and pressed forward. Oh, right under",Swann's Way
63107,"the horses' noses, you little demon! and there she was left on the kerb",Swann's Way
63107,"stretching her hand out, while Jimmy Dawes grinned on the further side.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"A charming woman, poised, eager, strangely white-haired for her pink",Swann's Way
63107,"cheeks, so Scope Purvis, C. B., saw her as he hurried to his office. She",Swann's Way
63107,"stiffened a little, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass. Big Ben struck",Swann's Way
63107,the tenth; struck the eleventh stroke. The leaden circles dissolved in,Swann's Way
63107,"the air. Pride held her erect, inheriting, handing on, acquainted with",Swann's Way
63107,"discipline and with suffering. How people suffered, how they suffered,",Swann's Way
63107,"she thought, thinking of Mrs Foxcroft at the Embassy last night decked",Swann's Way
63107,"with jewels, eating her heart out, because that nice boy was dead, and",Swann's Way
63107,now the old Manor House (Durtnall's van passed) must go to a cousin.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Good morning to you!"" said Hugh Whitbread raising his hat rather",Swann's Way
63107,"extravagantly by the china shop, for they had known each other as",Swann's Way
63107,"children. ""Where are you off to?""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""I love walking in London"" said Mrs Dalloway. ""Really it's better",Swann's Way
63107,"than walking in the country!""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""We've just come up"" said Hugh Whitbread. ""Unfortunately to see",Swann's Way
63107,"doctors.""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Milly?"" said Mrs Dalloway, instantly compassionate.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Out of sorts,"" said Hugh Whitbread. ""That sort of thing. Dick",Swann's Way
63107,"all right?""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""First rate!"" said Clarissa.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"Of course, she thought, walking on, Milly is about my",Swann's Way
63107,"age--fifty--fifty-two. So it is probably _that_, Hugh's manner had said",Swann's Way
63107,"so, said it perfectly--dear old Hugh, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering",Swann's Way
63107,"with amusement, with gratitude, with emotion, how shy, like a",Swann's Way
63107,brother--one would rather die than speak to one's brother--Hugh had,Swann's Way
63107,"always been, when he was at Oxford, and came over, and perhaps one of",Swann's Way
63107,them (drat the thing!) couldn't ride. How then could women sit in,Swann's Way
63107,Parliament? How could they do things with men? For there is this,Swann's Way
63107,"extraordinarily deep instinct, something inside one; you can't get over",Swann's Way
63107,it; it's no use trying; and men like Hugh respect it without our saying,Swann's Way
63107,"it, which is what one loves, thought Clarissa, in dear old Hugh.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,She had passed through the Admiralty Arch and saw at the end of the,Swann's Way
63107,"empty road with its thin trees Victoria's white mound, Victoria's",Swann's Way
63107,"billowing motherliness, amplitude and homeliness, always ridiculous, yet",Swann's Way
63107,"how sublime, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering Kensington Gardens and",Swann's Way
63107,the old lady in horn spectacles and being told by Nanny to stop dead,Swann's Way
63107,still and bow to the Queen. The flag flew above the Palace. The King and,Swann's Way
63107,Queen were back then. Dick had met her at lunch the other day--a,Swann's Way
63107,"thoroughly nice woman. It matters so much to the poor, thought Clarissa,",Swann's Way
63107,and to the soldiers. A man in bronze stood heroically on a pedestal with,Swann's Way
63107,"a gun on her left hand side--the South African war. It matters, thought",Swann's Way
63107,Mrs Dalloway walking towards Buckingham Palace. There it stood,Swann's Way
63107,"four-square, in the broad sunshine, uncompromising, plain. But it was",Swann's Way
63107,character she thought; something inborn in the race; what Indians,Swann's Way
63107,"respected. The Queen went to hospitals, opened bazaars--the Queen of",Swann's Way
63107,"England, thought Clarissa, looking at the Palace. Already at this hour a",Swann's Way
63107,motor car passed out at the gates; soldiers saluted; the gates were,Swann's Way
63107,"shut. And Clarissa, crossing the road, entered the Park, holding herself",Swann's Way
63107,upright.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,June had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The mothers of Westminster,Swann's Way
63107,with mottled breasts gave suck to their young. Quite respectable girls,Swann's Way
63107,"lay stretched on the grass. An elderly man, stooping very stiffly,",Swann's Way
63107,"picked up a crumpled paper, spread it out flat and flung it away. How",Swann's Way
63107,"horrible! Last night at the Embassy Sir Dighton had said ""If I want a",Swann's Way
63107,"fellow to hold my horse, I have only to put up my hand."" But the",Swann's Way
63107,"religious question is far more serious than the economic, Sir Dighton",Swann's Way
63107,"had said, which she thought extraordinarily interesting, from a man like",Swann's Way
63107,"Sir Dighton. ""Oh, the country will never know what it has lost"" he had",Swann's Way
63107,"said, talking, of his own accord, about dear Jack Stewart.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,She mounted the little hill lightly. The air stirred with energy.,Swann's Way
63107,Messages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty. Piccadilly and,Swann's Way
63107,Arlington Street and the Mall seemed to chafe the very air in the Park,Swann's Way
63107,"and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, upon waves of that divine",Swann's Way
63107,vitality which Clarissa loved. To ride; to dance; she had adored all,Swann's Way
63107,"that. Or going long walks in the country, talking, about books, what to",Swann's Way
63107,"do with one's life, for young people were amazingly priggish--oh, the",Swann's Way
63107,things one had said! But one had conviction. Middle age is the devil.,Swann's Way
63107,"People like Jack'll never know that, she thought; for he never once",Swann's Way
63107,"thought of death, never, they said, knew he was dying. And now can never",Swann's Way
63107,mourn--how did it go?--a head grown grey. . . . From the contagion of,Swann's Way
63107,the world's slow stain . . . have drunk their cup a round or two before.,Swann's Way
63107,. . . From the contagion of the world's slow stain! She held herself,Swann's Way
63107,upright.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"But how Jack would have shouted! Quoting Shelley, in Piccadilly! ""You",Swann's Way
63107,"want a pin,"" he would have said. He hated frumps. ""My God Clarissa! My",Swann's Way
63107,"God Clarissa!""--she could hear him now at the Devonshire House party,",Swann's Way
63107,about poor Sylvia Hunt in her amber necklace and that dowdy old silk.,Swann's Way
63107,Clarissa held herself upright for she had spoken aloud and now she was,Swann's Way
63107,"in Piccadilly, passing the house with the slender green columns, and the",Swann's Way
63107,balconies; passing club windows full of newspapers; passing old Lady,Swann's Way
63107,Burdett Coutts' house where the glazed white parrot used to hang; and,Swann's Way
63107,"Devonshire House, without its gilt leopards; and Claridge's, where she",Swann's Way
63107,must remember Dick wanted her to leave a card on Mrs Jepson or she would,Swann's Way
63107,be gone. Rich Americans can be very charming. There was St James palace;,Swann's Way
63107,like a child's game with bricks; and now--she had passed Bond,Swann's Way
63107,Street--she was by Hatchard's book shop. The stream was,Swann's Way
63107,"endless--endless--endless. Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham--what was it? What a",Swann's Way
63107,"duck, she thought, looking at the frontispiece of some book of memoirs",Swann's Way
63107,"spread wide in the bow window, Sir Joshua perhaps or Romney; arch,",Swann's Way
63107,"bright, demure; the sort of girl--like her own Elizabeth--the only",Swann's Way
63107,"_real_ sort of girl. And there was that absurd book, Soapy Sponge, which",Swann's Way
63107,Jim used to quote by the yard; and Shakespeare's Sonnets. She knew them,Swann's Way
63107,"by heart. Phil and she had argued all day about the Dark Lady, and Dick",Swann's Way
63107,had said straight out at dinner that night that he had never heard of,Swann's Way
63107,"her. Really, she had married him for that! He had never read",Swann's Way
63107,Shakespeare! There must be some little cheap book she could buy for,Swann's Way
63107,Milly--Cranford of course! Was there ever anything so enchanting as the,Swann's Way
63107,"cow in petticoats? If only people had that sort of humour, that sort of",Swann's Way
63107,"self-respect now, thought Clarissa, for she remembered the broad pages;",Swann's Way
63107,the sentences ending; the characters--how one talked about them as if,Swann's Way
63107,"they were real. For all the great things one must go to the past, she",Swann's Way
63107,thought. From the contagion of the world's slow stain. . . . Fear no,Swann's Way
63107,"more the heat o' the sun. . . . And now can never mourn, can never",Swann's Way
63107,"mourn, she repeated, her eyes straying over the window; for it ran in",Swann's Way
63107,her head; the test of great poetry; the moderns had never written,Swann's Way
63107,"anything one wanted to read about death, she thought; and turned.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,Omnibuses joined motor cars; motor cars vans; vans taxicabs; taxicabs,Swann's Way
63107,"motor cars--here was an open motor car with a girl, alone. Up till four,",Swann's Way
63107,"her feet tingling, I know, thought Clarissa, for the girl looked washed",Swann's Way
63107,"out, half asleep, in the corner of the car after the dance. And another",Swann's Way
63107,car came; and another. No! No! No! Clarissa smiled good-naturedly. The,Swann's Way
63107,"fat lady had taken every sort of trouble, but diamonds! orchids! at this",Swann's Way
63107,"hour of the morning! No! No! No! The excellent policeman would, when the",Swann's Way
63107,"time came, hold up his hand. Another motor car passed. How utterly",Swann's Way
63107,unattractive! Why should a girl of that age paint black round her eyes?,Swann's Way
63107,"And a young man, with a girl, at this hour, when the country--The",Swann's Way
63107,"admirable policeman raised his hand and Clarissa acknowledging his sway,",Swann's Way
63107,"taking her time, crossed, walked towards Bond Street; saw the narrow",Swann's Way
63107,"crooked street, the yellow banners; the thick notched telegraph wires",Swann's Way
63107,stretched across the sky.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"A hundred years ago her great-great-grandfather, Seymour Parry, who ran",Swann's Way
63107,"away with Conway's daughter, had walked down Bond Street. Down Bond",Swann's Way
63107,"Street the Parrys had walked for a hundred years, and might have met the",Swann's Way
63107,Dalloways (Leighs on the mother's side) going up. Her father got his,Swann's Way
63107,"clothes from Hill's. There was a roll of cloth in the window, and here",Swann's Way
63107,"just one jar on a black table, incredibly expensive; like the thick pink",Swann's Way
63107,salmon on the ice block at the fishmonger's. The jewels were,Swann's Way
63107,"exquisite--pink and orange stars, paste, Spanish, she thought, and",Swann's Way
63107,"chains of old gold; starry buckles, little brooches which had been worn",Swann's Way
63107,on sea green satin by ladies with high head-dresses. But no good,Swann's Way
63107,looking! One must economize. She must go on past the picture dealer's,Swann's Way
63107,"where one of the odd French pictures hung, as if people had thrown",Swann's Way
63107,confetti--pink and blue--for a joke. If you had lived with pictures (and,Swann's Way
63107,"it's the same with books and music) thought Clarissa, passing the",Swann's Way
63107,"Aeolian Hall, you can't be taken in by a joke.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"The river of Bond Street was clogged. There, like a Queen at a",Swann's Way
63107,"tournament, raised, regal, was Lady Bexborough. She sat in her carriage,",Swann's Way
63107,"upright, alone, looking through her glasses. The white glove was loose",Swann's Way
63107,"at her wrist. She was in black, quite shabby, yet, thought Clarissa, how",Swann's Way
63107,"extraordinarily it tells, breeding, self-respect, never saying a word",Swann's Way
63107,too much or letting people gossip; an astonishing friend; no one can,Swann's Way
63107,"pick a hole in her after all these years, and now, there she is, thought",Swann's Way
63107,"Clarissa, passing the Countess who waited powdered, perfectly still, and",Swann's Way
63107,"Clarissa would have given anything to be like that, the mistress of",Swann's Way
63107,"Clarefield, talking politics, like a man. But she never goes anywhere,",Swann's Way
63107,"thought Clarissa, and it's quite useless to ask her, and the carriage",Swann's Way
63107,"went on and Lady Bexborough was borne past like a Queen at a tournament,",Swann's Way
63107,though she had nothing to live for and the old man is failing and they,Swann's Way
63107,"say she is sick of it all, thought Clarissa and the tears actually rose",Swann's Way
63107,to her eyes as she entered the shop.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Good morning"" said Clarissa in her charming voice. ""Gloves"" she said",Swann's Way
63107,with her exquisite friendliness and putting her bag on the counter,Swann's Way
63107,"began, very slowly, to undo the buttons. ""White gloves"" she said. ""Above",Swann's Way
63107,"the elbow"" and she looked straight into the shopwoman's face--but this",Swann's Way
63107,"was not the girl she remembered? She looked quite old. ""These really",Swann's Way
63107,"don't fit"" said Clarissa. The shop girl looked at them. ""Madame wears",Swann's Way
63107,"bracelets?"" Clarissa spread out her fingers. ""Perhaps it's my rings.""",Swann's Way
63107,And the girl took the grey gloves with her to the end of the counter.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"Yes, thought Clarissa, if it's the girl I remember she's twenty years",Swann's Way
63107,"older. . . . There was only one other customer, sitting sideways at the",Swann's Way
63107,"counter, her elbow poised, her bare hand drooping, vacant; like a figure",Swann's Way
63107,"on a Japanese fan, thought Clarissa, too vacant perhaps, yet some men",Swann's Way
63107,would adore her. The lady shook her head sadly. Again the gloves were,Swann's Way
63107,"too large. She turned round the glass. ""Above the wrist"" she reproached",Swann's Way
63107,the grey-headed woman; who looked and agreed.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"They waited; a clock ticked; Bond Street hummed, dulled, distant; the",Swann's Way
63107,"woman went away holding gloves. ""Above the wrist"" said the lady,",Swann's Way
63107,"mournfully, raising her voice. And she would have to order chairs, ices,",Swann's Way
63107,"flowers, and cloak-room tickets, thought Clarissa. The people she didn't",Swann's Way
63107,want would come; the others wouldn't. She would stand by the door. They,Swann's Way
63107,sold stockings--silk stockings. A lady is known by her gloves and her,Swann's Way
63107,"shoes, old Uncle William used to say. And through the hanging silk",Swann's Way
63107,"stockings quivering silver she looked at the lady, sloping shouldered,",Swann's Way
63107,"her hand drooping, her bag slipping, her eyes vacantly on the floor. It",Swann's Way
63107,would be intolerable if dowdy women came to her party! Would one have,Swann's Way
63107,"liked Keats if he had worn red socks? Oh, at last--she drew into the",Swann's Way
63107,counter and it flashed into her mind:,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Do you remember before the war you had gloves with pearl buttons?""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""French gloves, Madame?""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Yes, they were French"" said Clarissa. The other lady rose very sadly",Swann's Way
63107,"and took her bag, and looked at the gloves on the counter. But they were",Swann's Way
63107,all too large--always too large at the wrist.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""With pearl buttons"" said the shop-girl, who looked ever so much older.",Swann's Way
63107,She split the lengths of tissue paper apart on the counter. With pearl,Swann's Way
63107,"buttons, thought Clarissa, perfectly simple--how French!",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Madame's hands are so slender"" said the shop girl, drawing the glove",Swann's Way
63107,"firmly, smoothly, down over her rings. And Clarissa looked at her arm in",Swann's Way
63107,the looking glass. The glove hardly came to the elbow. Were there others,Swann's Way
63107,half an inch longer? Still it seemed tiresome to bother her--perhaps the,Swann's Way
63107,"one day in the month, thought Clarissa, when it's an agony to stand.",Swann's Way
63107,"""Oh, don't bother"" she said. But the gloves were brought.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""Don't you get fearfully tired"" she said in her charming voice,",Swann's Way
63107,"""standing? When d'you get your holiday?""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""In September, Madame, when we're not so busy.""",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,When we're in the country thought Clarissa. Or shooting. She has a,Swann's Way
63107,fortnight at Brighton. In some stuffy lodging. The landlady takes the,Swann's Way
63107,sugar. Nothing would be easier than to send her to Mrs Lumley's right in,Swann's Way
63107,the country (and it was on the tip of her tongue). But then she,Swann's Way
63107,remembered how on their honeymoon Dick had shown her the folly of giving,Swann's Way
63107,"impulsively. It was much more important, he said, to get trade with",Swann's Way
63107,China. Of course he was right. And she could feel the girl wouldn't like,Swann's Way
63107,to be given things. There she was in her place. So was Dick. Selling,Swann's Way
63107,"gloves was her job. She had her own sorrows quite separate, ""and now can",Swann's Way
63107,"never mourn, can never mourn"" the words ran in her head, ""From the",Swann's Way
63107,"contagion of the world's slow stain"" thought Clarissa holding her arm",Swann's Way
63107,"stiff, for there are moments when it seems utterly futile (the glove was",Swann's Way
63107,drawn off leaving her arm flecked with powder)--simply one doesn't,Swann's Way
63107,"believe, thought Clarissa, any more in God.",Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,The traffic suddenly roared; the silk stockings brightened. A,Swann's Way
63107,customer came in.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"""White gloves,"" she said, with some ring in her voice that Clarissa",Swann's Way
63107,remembered.,Swann's Way
63107,,Swann's Way
63107,"It used, thought Clarissa, to be so simple. Down down through the air",Swann's Way
63107,"came the caw of the rooks. When Sylvia died, hundreds of years ago, the",Swann's Way
63107,yew hedges looked so lovely with the diamond webs in the mist before,Swann's Way
63107,early church. But if Dick were to die to-morrow as for believing in,Swann's Way
63107,"God--no, she would let the children choose, but for herself, like Lady",Swann's Way
63107,"Bexborough, who opened the bazaar, they say, with the telegram in her",Swann's Way
63107,"hand--Roden, her favourite, killed--she would go on. But why, if one",Swann's Way
63107,"doesn't believe? For the sake of others, she thought, taking the glove",Swann's Way
63107,in her hand. This girl would be much more unhappy if she didn't believe.,Swann's Way
