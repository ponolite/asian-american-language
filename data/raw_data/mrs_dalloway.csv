5670,"concentration in the air. Behind the grey walls sat so many young men,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"the court, while an elderly man, in a green apron, carrying an immense",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"pile of tin covers, hesitated, balanced, and then went on. But this was",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"a diversion. There were young men who read, lying in shallow arm-chairs,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,holding their books as if they had hold in their hands of something that,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"would see them through; they being all in a torment, coming from midland",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"towns, clergymen's sons. Others read Keats. And those long histories in",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,many volumes--surely some one was now beginning at the beginning in,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"order to understand the Holy Roman Empire, as one must. That was part of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the concentration, though it would be dangerous on a hot spring",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"night--dangerous, perhaps, to concentrate too much upon single books,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"actual chapters, when at any moment the door opened and Jacob appeared;",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"or Richard Bonamy, reading Keats no longer, began making long pink",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"spills from an old newspaper, bending forward, and looking eager and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"contented no more, but almost fierce. Why? Only perhaps that Keats died",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"young--one wants to write poetry too and to love--oh, the brutes! It's",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"damnably difficult. But, after all, not so difficult if on the next",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"staircase, in the large room, there are two, three, five young men all",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"convinced of this--of brutality, that is, and the clear division between",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"right and wrong. There was a sofa, chairs, a square table, and the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"window being open, one could see how they sat--legs issuing here, one",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"there crumpled in a corner of the sofa; and, presumably, for you could",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"not see him, somebody stood by the fender, talking. Anyhow, Jacob, who",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"sat astride a chair and ate dates from a long box, burst out laughing.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"The answer came from the sofa corner; for his pipe was held in the air,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"though the sturdy red-haired boy at the table seemed to deny it, wagging",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"his head slowly from side to side; and then, taking out his penknife, he",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"dug the point of it again and again into a knot in the table, as if",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,affirming that the voice from the fender spoke the truth--which Jacob,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"could not deny. Possibly, when he had done arranging the date-stones, he",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,might find something to say to it--indeed his lips opened--only then,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,there broke out a roar of laughter.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The laughter died in the air. The sound of it could scarcely have,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"reached any one standing by the Chapel, which stretched along the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"opposite side of the court. The laughter died out, and only gestures of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"arms, movements of bodies, could be seen shaping something in the room.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Was it an argument? A bet on the boat races? Was it nothing of the sort?,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,What was shaped by the arms and bodies moving in the twilight room?,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"A step or two beyond the window there was nothing at all, except the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"enclosing buildings--chimneys upright, roofs horizontal; too much brick",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and building for a May night, perhaps. And then before one's eyes would",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"come the bare hills of Turkey--sharp lines, dry earth, coloured flowers,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and colour on the shoulders of the women, standing naked-legged in the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,stream to beat linen on the stones. The stream made loops of water round,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,their ankles. But none of that could show clearly through the swaddlings,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and blanketings of the Cambridge night. The stroke of the clock even was,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,muffled; as if intoned by somebody reverent from a pulpit; as if,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,generations of learned men heard the last hour go rolling through their,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,for the use of the living.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Was it to receive this gift from the past that the young man came to the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,stood smoking his pipe while the last stroke of the clock purred softly,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"indeed masterly; which expression changed slightly as he stood there,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"backwards she cast her mind, as if the roofless cottages, mounds of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"slag, and cottage gardens overgrown with foxglove and bramble cast shade",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"upon her mind. Arrived at the summit, she stopped the carriage. The pale",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hills were round her, each scattered with ancient stones; beneath was",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the sea, variable as a southern sea; she herself sat there looking from",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hill to sea, upright, aquiline, equally poised between gloom and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,laughter. Suddenly she flicked the ponies so that the boy Curnow had to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,swing himself up by the toe of his boot.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,The rooks settled; the rooks rose. The trees which they touched so,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,capriciously seemed insufficient to lodge their numbers. The tree-tops,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sang with the breeze in them; the branches creaked audibly and dropped,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"now and then, though the season was midsummer, husks or twigs. Up went",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,enough to make the air inside the wood almost dark. The moss was soft;,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the tree-trunks spectral. Beyond them lay a silvery meadow. The pampas,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,grass raised its feathery spears from mounds of green at the end of the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,meadow. A breadth of water gleamed. Already the convolvulus moth was,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"spinning over the flowers. Orange and purple, nasturtium and cherry pie,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"were washed into the twilight, but the tobacco plant and the passion",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"flower, over which the great moth spun, were white as china. The rooks",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"creaked their wings together on the tree-tops, and were settling down",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"for sleep when, far off, a familiar sound shook and trembled--increased",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"whether exposed or not, tingled and glowed so as to make even black",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,the table-cloth. Surreptitiously it closed upon slim glasses and curved,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,silver forks. The bones of the cutlets were decorated with pink,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,frills-and yesterday he had gnawn ham from the bone! Opposite him were,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"was the grey-green garden, and among the pear-shaped leaves of the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,escallonia fishing-boats seemed caught and suspended. A sailing ship,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,slowly drew past the women's backs. Two or three figures crossed the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"""I rather think,"" said Jacob, taking his pipe from his mouth, ""it's in",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Virgil,"" and pushing back his chair, he went to the window.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"The rashest drivers in the world are, certainly, the drivers of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"post-office vans. Swinging down Lamb's Conduit Street, the scarlet van",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,rounded the corner by the pillar box in such a way as to graze the kerb,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and make the little girl who was standing on tiptoe to post a letter,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"look up, half frightened, half curious. She paused with her hand in the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,mouth of the box; then dropped her letter and ran away. It is seldom,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,only that we see a child on tiptoe with pity--more often a dim,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"discomfort, a grain of sand in the shoe which it's scarcely worth while",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"to remove--that's our feeling, and so--Jacob turned to the bookcase.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Long ago great people lived here, and coming back from Court past",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"midnight stood, huddling their satin skirts, under the carved door-posts",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"while the footman roused himself from his mattress on the floor,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hurriedly fastened the lower buttons of his waistcoat, and let them in.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The bitter eighteenth-century rain rushed down the kennel. Southampton,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Row, however, is chiefly remarkable nowadays for the fact that you will",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"always find a man there trying to sell a tortoise to a tailor. ""Showing",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"off the tweed, sir; what the gentry wants is something singular to catch",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the eye, sir--and clean in their habits, sir!"" So they display their",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,tortoises.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,At Mudie's corner in Oxford Street all the red and blue beads had run,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,together on the string. The motor omnibuses were locked. Mr. Spalding,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound for Shepherd's,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Bush. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet few took advantage of,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,it. Each had his own business to think of. Each had his past shut in him,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,like the leaves of a book known to him by heart; and his friends could,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"only read the title, James Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all--save ""a man",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"with a red moustache,"" ""a young man in grey smoking a pipe."" The October",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sunlight rested upon all these men and women sitting immobile; and,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"carrying his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"between the wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and was soon out of sight--for ever. The omnibuses jerked on, and every",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey's end,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"of indulgence beyond--steak and kidney pudding, drink or a game of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant. Oh yes, human life is",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn, when the policeman",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back, and if there is such a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it, on",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the banks of the Thames, where the great streets join and St. Paul's",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Cathedral, like the volute on the top of the snail shell, finishes it",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"off. Jacob, getting off his omnibus, loitered up the steps, consulted",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"his watch, and finally made up his mind to go in.... Does it need an",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,effort? Yes. These changes of mood wear us out.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Dim it is, haunted by ghosts of white marble, to whom the organ for ever",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"chaunts. If a boot creaks, it's awful; then the order; the discipline.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The verger with his rod has life ironed out beneath him. Sweet and holy,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"are the angelic choristers. And for ever round the marble shoulders, in",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and out of the folded fingers, go the thin high sounds of voice and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,organ. For ever requiem--repose. Tired with scrubbing the steps of the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Prudential Society's office, which she did year in year out, Mrs.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Lidgett took her seat beneath the great Duke's tomb, folded her hands,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and half closed her eyes. A magnificent place for an old woman to rest,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"in, by the very side of the great Duke's bones, whose victories mean",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"nothing to her, whose name she knows not, though she never fails to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"greet the little angels opposite, as she passes out, wishing the like on",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"her own tomb, for the leathern curtain of the heart has flapped wide,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and out steal on tiptoe thoughts of rest, sweet melodies.... Old Spicer,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"jute merchant, thought nothing of the kind though. Strangely enough he'd",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"never been in St. Paul's these fifty years, though his office windows",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"looked on the churchyard. ""So that's all? Well, a gloomy old place....",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Where's Nelson's tomb? No time now--come again--a coin to leave in the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"box.... Rain or fine is it? Well, if it would only make up its mind!""",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Idly the children stray in--the verger dissuades them--and another and,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"another ... man, woman, man, woman, boy ... casting their eyes up,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"pursing their lips, the same shadow brushing the same faces; the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,leathern curtain of the heart flaps wide.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Nothing could appear more certain from the steps of St. Paul's than that,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"each person is miraculously provided with coat, skirt, and boots; an",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"income; an object. Only Jacob, carrying in his hand Finlay's Byzantine",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Empire, which he had bought in Ludgate Hill, looked a little different;",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"for in his hand he carried a book, which book he would at nine-thirty",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"precisely, by his own fireside, open and study, as no one else of all",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,these multitudes would do. They have no houses. The streets belong to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,them; the shops; the churches; theirs the innumerable desks; the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"stretched office lights; the vans are theirs, and the railway slung high",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,above the street. If you look closer you will see that three elderly men,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,at a little distance from each other run spiders along the pavement as,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"if the street were their parlour, and here, against the wall, a woman",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"stares at nothing, boot-laces extended, which she does not ask you to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,buy. The posters are theirs too; and the news on them. A town destroyed;,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"a race won. A homeless people, circling beneath the sky whose blue or",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,white is held off by a ceiling cloth of steel filings and horse dung,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,shredded to dust.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"There, under the green shade, with his head bent over white paper, Mr.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Sibley transferred figures to folios, and upon each desk you observe,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"like provender, a bunch of papers, the day's nutriment, slowly consumed",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,by the industrious pen. Innumerable overcoats of the quality prescribed,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hung empty all day in the corridors, but as the clock struck six each",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"was exactly filled, and the little figures, split apart into trousers or",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"moulded into a single thickness, jerked rapidly with angular forward",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,motion along the pavement; then dropped into darkness. Beneath the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"pavement, sunk in the earth, hollow drains lined with yellow light for",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"ever conveyed them this way and that, and large letters upon enamel",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"plates represented in the underworld the parks, squares, and circuses of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the upper. ""Marble Arch--Shepherd's Bush""--to the majority the Arch and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the Bush are eternally white letters upon a blue ground. Only at one,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"point--it may be Acton, Holloway, Kensal Rise, Caledonian Road--does the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"name mean shops where you buy things, and houses, in one of which, down",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"to the right, where the pollard trees grow out of the paving stones,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"there is a square curtained window, and a bedroom.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Long past sunset an old blind woman sat on a camp-stool with her back to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the stone wall of the Union of London and Smith's Bank, clasping a brown",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"mongrel tight in her arms and singing out loud, not for coppers, no,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"from the depths of her gay wild heart--her sinful, tanned heart--for the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"child who fetches her is the fruit of sin, and should have been in bed,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"curtained, asleep, instead of hearing in the lamplight her mother's wild",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"song, where she sits against the Bank, singing not for coppers, with her",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,dog against her breast.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Home they went. The grey church spires received them; the hoary city,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"old, sinful, and majestic. One behind another, round or pointed,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"piercing the sky or massing themselves, like sailing ships, like granite",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"cliffs, spires and offices, wharves and factories crowd the bank;",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,eternally the pilgrims trudge; barges rest in mid stream heavy laden; as,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"some believe, the city loves her prostitutes.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"But few, it seems, are admitted to that degree. Of all the carriages",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"that leave the arch of the Opera House, not one turns eastward, and when",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the little thief is caught in the empty market-place no one in,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,black-and-white or rose-coloured evening dress blocks the way by pausing,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,with a hand upon the carriage door to help or condemn--though Lady,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Charles, to do her justice, sighs sadly as she ascends her staircase,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"takes down Thomas a Kempis, and does not sleep till her mind has lost",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"itself tunnelling into the complexity of things. ""Why? Why? Why?"" she",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sighs. On the whole it's best to walk back from the Opera House. Fatigue,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,is the safest sleeping draught.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The autumn season was in full swing. Tristan was twitching his rug up,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,under his armpits twice a week; Isolde waved her scarf in miraculous,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sympathy with the conductor's baton. In all parts of the house were to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,be found pink faces and glittering breasts. When a Royal hand attached,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,to an invisible body slipped out and withdrew the red and white bouquet,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"reposing on the scarlet ledge, the Queen of England seemed a name worth",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"dying for. Beauty, in its hothouse variety (which is none of the worst),",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,flowered in box after box; and though nothing was said of profound,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"importance, and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,beautiful lips about the time that Walpole died--at any rate when,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Victoria in her nightgown descended to meet her ministers, the lips",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"(through an opera glass) remained red, adorable. Bald distinguished men",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,with gold-headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"stalls, and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when the lights",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"went down, and the conductor, first bowing to the Queen, next to the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"bald-headed men, swept round on his feet and raised his wand.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Then two thousand hearts in the semi-darkness remembered, anticipated,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,travelled dark labyrinths; and Clara Durrant said farewell to Jacob,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Flanders, and tasted the sweetness of death in effigy; and Mrs. Durrant,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"sitting behind her in the dark of the box, sighed her sharp sigh; and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Mr. Wortley, shifting his position behind the Italian Ambassador's wife,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,thought that Brangaena was a trifle hoarse; and suspended in the gallery,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"many feet above their heads, Edward Whittaker surreptitiously held a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,torch to his miniature score; and ... and ...,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"In short, the observer is choked with observations. Only to prevent us",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"from being submerged by chaos, nature and society between them have",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"arranged a system of classification which is simplicity itself; stalls,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"boxes, amphitheatre, gallery. The moulds are filled nightly. There is no",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,need to distinguish details. But the difficulty remains--one has to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,choose. For though I have no wish to be Queen of England or only for a,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,moment--I would willingly sit beside her; I would hear the Prime,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Minister's gossip; the countess whisper, and share her memories of halls",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and gardens; the massive fronts of the respectable conceal after all,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"their secret code; or why so impermeable? And then, doffing one's own",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"headpiece, how strange to assume for a moment some one's--any one's--to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,be a man of valour who has ruled the Empire; to refer while Brangaena,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"sings to the fragments of Sophocles, or see in a flash, as the shepherd",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"pipes his tune, bridges and aqueducts. But no--we must choose. Never was",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"there a harsher necessity! or one which entails greater pain, more",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"certain disaster; for wherever I seat myself, I die in exile: Whittaker",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,in his lodging-house; Lady Charles at the Manor.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"A young man with a Wellington nose, who had occupied a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"seven-and-sixpenny seat, made his way down the stone stairs when the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"opera ended, as if he were still set a little apart from his fellows by",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the influence of the music.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,At midnight Jacob Flanders heard a rap on his door.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""By Jove!"" he exclaimed. ""You're the very man I want!"" and without more",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,ado they discovered the lines which he had been seeking all day; only,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"they come not in Virgil, but in Lucretius.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""Yes; that should make him sit up,"" said Bonamy, as Jacob stopped",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,reading. Jacob was excited. It was the first time he had read his essay,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,aloud.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""Damned swine!"" he said, rather too extravagantly; but the praise had",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"gone to his head. Professor Bulteel, of Leeds, had issued an edition of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Wycherley without stating that he had left out, disembowelled, or",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"indicated only by asterisks, several indecent words and some indecent",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"phrases. An outrage, Jacob said; a breach of faith; sheer prudery; token",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,of a lewd mind and a disgusting nature. Aristophanes and Shakespeare,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,were cited. Modern life was repudiated. Great play was made with the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"professional title, and Leeds as a seat of learning was laughed to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,scorn. And the extraordinary thing was that these young men were,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"perfectly right--extraordinary, because, even as Jacob copied his pages,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,he knew that no one would ever print them; and sure enough back they,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"came from the Fortnightly, the Contemporary, the Nineteenth",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Century--when Jacob threw them into the black wooden box where he kept,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"his mother's letters, his old flannel trousers, and a note or two with",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the Cornish postmark. The lid shut upon the truth.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"This black wooden box, upon which his name was still legible in white",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"paint, stood between the long windows of the sitting-room. The street",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,ran beneath. No doubt the bedroom was behind. The furniture--three,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,wicker chairs and a gate-legged table--came from Cambridge. These houses,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"(Mrs. Garfit's daughter, Mrs. Whitehorn, was the landlady of this one)",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"were built, say, a hundred and fifty years ago. The rooms are shapely,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the ceilings high; over the doorway a rose, or a ram's skull, is carved",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,in the wood. The eighteenth century has its distinction. Even the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"the word for him. Lying back in his chair, taking his pipe from his",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"lips, and saying to Bonamy: ""About this opera now"" (for they had done",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"with indecency). ""This fellow Wagner"" ... distinction was one of the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"words to use naturally, though, from looking at him, one would have",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"found it difficult to say which seat in the opera house was his, stalls,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"gallery, or dress circle. A writer? He lacked self-consciousness. A",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,painter? There was something in the shape of his hands (he was descended,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,on his mother's side from a family of the greatest antiquity and deepest,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"obscurity) which indicated taste. Then his mouth--but surely, of all",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,futile occupations this of cataloguing features is the worst. One word,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,is sufficient. But if one cannot find it?,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"""I like Jacob Flanders,"" wrote Clara Durrant in her diary. ""He is so",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"But then, this is only a young woman's language, one, too, who loves, or",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,CHAPTER SEVEN,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,About this time a firm of merchants having dealings with the East put on,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,the market little paper flowers which opened on touching water. As it,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"was the custom also to use finger-bowls at the end of dinner, the new",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,discovery was found of excellent service. In these sheltered lakes the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"little coloured flowers swam and slid; surmounted smooth slippery waves,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and sometimes foundered and lay like pebbles on the glass floor. Their,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,fortunes were watched by eyes intent and lovely. It is surely a great,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,discovery that leads to the union of hearts and foundation of homes. The,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,paper flowers did no less.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"It must not be thought, though, that they ousted the flowers of nature.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Roses, lilies, carnations in particular, looked over the rims of vases",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and surveyed the bright lives and swift dooms of their artificial,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,relations. Mr. Stuart Ormond made this very observation; and charming it,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,was thought; and Kitty Craster married him on the strength of it six,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,months later. But real flowers can never be dispensed with. If they,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"could, human life would be a different affair altogether. For flowers",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,fade; chrysanthemums are the worst; perfect over night; yellow and jaded,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"next morning--not fit to be seen. On the whole, though the price is",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"sinful, carnations pay best;--it's a question, however, whether it's",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,wise to have them wired. Some shops advise it. Certainly it's the only,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,way to keep them at a dance; but whether it is necessary at dinner,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"parties, unless the rooms are very hot, remains in dispute. Old Mrs.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Temple used to recommend an ivy leaf--just one--dropped into the bowl.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,She said it kept the water pure for days and days. But there is some,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,reason to think that old Mrs. Temple was mistaken.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"The little cards, however, with names engraved on them, are a more",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"serious problem than the flowers. More horses' legs have been worn out,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"more coachmen's lives consumed, more hours of sound afternoon time",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"vainly lavished than served to win us the battle of Waterloo, and pay",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,for it into the bargain. The little demons are the source of as many,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"reprieves, calamities, and anxieties as the battle itself. Sometimes",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Mrs. Bonham has just gone out; at others she is at home. But, even if",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the cards should be superseded, which seems unlikely, there are unruly",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"powers blowing life into storms, disordering sedulous mornings, and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"uprooting the stability of the afternoon--dressmakers, that is to say,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and confectioners' shops. Six yards of silk will cover one body; but if,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"you have to devise six hundred shapes for it, and twice as many",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,colours?--in the middle of which there is the urgent question of the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"five shillings out-door relief, and help from her only son employed in",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"fierce with light. Raw meat, china mugs, and silk stockings blaze in it.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Raw voices wrap themselves round the flaring gas-jets. Arms akimbo, they",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,stand on the pavement bawling--Messrs. Kettle and Wilkinson; their wives,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"sit in the shop, furs wrapped round their necks, arms folded, eyes",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,contemptuous. Such faces as one sees. The little man fingering the meat,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"must have squatted before the fire in innumerable lodging-houses, and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,heard and seen and known so much that it seems to utter itself even,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"volubly from dark eyes, loose lips, as he fingers the meat silently, his",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"face sad as a poet's, and never a song sung. Shawled women carry babies",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,defiant. (What people go through in half an hour! But nothing could save,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The Countess of Rocksbier sat at the head of the table alone with Jacob.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Fed upon champagne and spices for at least two centuries (four, if you",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"count the female line), the Countess Lucy looked well fed. A",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"discriminating nose she had for scents, prolonged, as if in quest of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"them; her underlip protruded a narrow red shelf; her eyes were small,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"with sandy tufts for eyebrows, and her jowl was heavy. Behind her (the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"window looked on Grosvenor Square) stood Moll Pratt on the pavement,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"offering violets for sale; and Mrs. Hilda Thomas, lifting her skirts,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,preparing to cross the road. One was from Walworth; the other from,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Putney. Both wore black stockings, but Mrs. Thomas was coiled in furs.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The comparison was much in Lady Rocksbier's favour. Moll had more,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"humour, but was violent; stupid too. Hilda Thomas was mealy-mouthed, all",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,her silver frames aslant; egg-cups in the drawing-room; and the windows,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"shrouded. Lady Rocksbier, whatever the deficiencies of her profile, had",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"been a great rider to hounds. She used her knife with authority, tore",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"her chicken bones, asking Jacob's pardon, with her own hands.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""Who is that driving by?"" she asked Boxall, the butler.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""Lady Firtlemere's carriage, my lady,"" which reminded her to send a card",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"to ask after his lordship's health. A rude old lady, Jacob thought. The",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"wine was excellent. She called herself ""an old woman""--""so kind to lunch",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"with an old woman""--which flattered him. She talked of Joseph",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Chamberlain, whom she had known. She said that Jacob must come and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,meet--one of our celebrities. And the Lady Alice came in with three dogs,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"on a leash, and Jackie, who ran to kiss his grandmother, while Boxall",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"Dudding appeared at the doorway with their skirts hitched up, and hair",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"moved out, and Jacob went into the bar with Brandy Jones to smoke with",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the rustics. There was old Jevons with one eye gone, and his clothes the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"inquisitive old woman gets a name wrong, what chance is there that she",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,will faithfully report an argument? As she held the plates under water,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and then dealt them on the pile beneath the hissing gas, she listened:",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,heard Sanders speaking in a loud rather overbearing tone of voice:,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""good,"" he said, and ""absolute"" and ""justice"" and ""punishment,"" and ""the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"will of the majority."" Then her gentleman piped up; she backed him for",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,argument against Sanders. Yet Sanders was a fine young fellow (here all,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"the scraps went swirling round the sink, scoured after by her purple,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"almost nailless hands). ""Women""--she thought, and wondered what Sanders",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"and her gentleman did in THAT line, one eyelid sinking perceptibly as",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"she mused, for she was the mother of nine--three still-born and one deaf",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and dumb from birth. Putting the plates in the rack she heard once more,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"""Objective something,"" said Bonamy; and ""common ground"" and something",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"noticed her. She felt motherly towards them. ""Your breakfast, sir,"" she",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"said, as they came near. And Bonamy, all his hair touzled and his tie",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"the grass to read a name, hurrying on when the grave-keeper approached,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hurrying into the street, pausing now by a window with blue china, now",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"quickly making up for lost time, abruptly entering a baker's shop,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"buying rolls, adding cakes, going on again so that any one wishing to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"follow must fairly trot. She was not drably shabby, though. She wore",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"silk stockings, and silver-buckled shoes, only the red feather in her",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"hat drooped, and the clasp of her bag was weak, for out fell a copy of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Madame Tussaud's programme as she walked. She had the ankles of a stag.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Her face was hidden. Of course, in this dusk, rapid movements, quick",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"glances, and soaring hopes come naturally enough. She passed right",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,beneath Jacob's window.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"The house was flat, dark, and silent. Jacob was at home engaged upon a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"chess problem, the board being on a stool between his knees. One hand",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,was fingering the hair at the back of his head. He slowly brought it,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,forward and raised the white queen from her square; then put her down,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,again on the same spot. He filled his pipe; ruminated; moved two pawns;,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,advanced the white knight; then ruminated with one finger upon the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,bishop. Now Fanny Elmer passed beneath the window.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,She was on her way to sit to Nick Bramham the painter.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"She sat in a flowered Spanish shawl, holding in her hand a yellow novel.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"""A little lower, a little looser, so--better, that's right,"" Bramham",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"mumbled, who was drawing her, and smoking at the same time, and was",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"naturally speechless. His head might have been the work of a sculptor,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"who had squared the forehead, stretched the mouth, and left marks of his",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,thumbs and streaks from his fingers in the clay. But the eyes had never,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"been shut. They were rather prominent, and rather bloodshot, as if from",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"staring and staring, and when he spoke they looked for a second",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"disturbed, but went on staring. An unshaded electric light hung above",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,her head.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"As for the beauty of women, it is like the light on the sea, never",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,constant to a single wave. They all have it; they all lose it. Now she,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,is dull and thick as bacon; now transparent as a hanging glass. The,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,fixed faces are the dull ones. Here comes Lady Venice displayed like a,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"monument for admiration, but carved in alabaster, to be set on the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,mantelpiece and never dusted. A dapper brunette complete from head to,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,foot serves only as an illustration to lie upon the drawing-room table.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,The women in the streets have the faces of playing cards; the outlines,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"accurately filled in with pink or yellow, and the line drawn tightly",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"round them. Then, at a top-floor window, leaning out, looking down, you",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,see beauty itself; or in the corner of an omnibus; or squatted in a,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"ditch--beauty glowing, suddenly expressive, withdrawn the moment after.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,No one can count on it or seize it or have it wrapped in paper. Nothing,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"is to be won from the shops, and Heaven knows it would be better to sit",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,at home than haunt the plate-glass windows in the hope of lifting the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"shining green, the glowing ruby, out of them alive. Sea glass in a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,saucer loses its lustre no sooner than silks do. Thus if you talk of a,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,beautiful woman you mean only something flying fast which for a second,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"with brilliant cheeks and dark hair, sulky just now, or stiff with",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sitting. When Bramham snapped his stick of charcoal she started. Bramham,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,was out of temper. He squatted before the gas fire warming his hands.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Meanwhile she looked at his drawing. He grunted. Fanny threw on a,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,dressing-gown and boiled a kettle.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"Fanny dropped on to the floor, clasped her hands round her knees, and",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"looked at him, her beautiful eyes--yes, beauty, flying through the room,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"shone there for a second. Fanny's eyes seemed to question, to",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"commiserate, to be, for a second, love itself. But she exaggerated.",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"Bramham noticed nothing. And when the kettle boiled, up she scrambled,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,more like a colt or a puppy than a loving woman.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Now Jacob walked over to the window and stood with his hands in his,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"went in again. The children drifted past, eyeing the pink sticks of",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,sweetstuff. Pickford's van swung down the street. A small boy twirled,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,from a rope. Jacob turned away. Two minutes later he opened the front,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Fanny Elmer took down her cloak from the hook. Nick Bramham unpinned his,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"off down the street, holding on their way through all the people, motor",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"cars, omnibuses, carts, until they reached Leicester Square, five",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"minutes before Jacob reached it, for his way was slightly longer, and he",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"had been stopped by a block in Holborn waiting to see the King drive by,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,so that Nick and Fanny were already leaning over the barrier in the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,Very awkward he was. And when they sat upon a plush sofa and let the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"smoke go up between them and the stage, and heard far off the",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,high-pitched voices and the jolly orchestra breaking in opportunely he,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"was still awkward, only Fanny thought: ""What a beautiful voice!"" She",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,thought how little he said yet how firm it was. She thought how young,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"men are dignified and aloof, and how unconscious they are, and how",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,quietly one might sit beside Jacob and look at him. And how childlike he,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"would be, come in tired of an evening, she thought, and how majestic; a",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"little overbearing perhaps; ""But I wouldn't give way,"" she thought. He",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,got up and leant over the barrier. The smoke hung about him.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"And for ever the beauty of young men seems to be set in smoke, however",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"lustily they chase footballs, or drive cricket balls, dance, run, or",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,stride along roads. Possibly they are soon to lose it. Possibly they,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"beautifully, each word falling like a disc new cut, not a hubble-bubble",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"Then there she was herself, whirling across the stage in white flounces,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,"The body after long illness is languid, passive, receptive of sweetness,",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,barking. The motor cars hooted on the road. She heard a far-away rush,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,and humming. Agitation was at her heart. Up she got and walked. The,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,grass was freshly green; the sun hot. All round the pond children were,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,stooping to launch little boats; or were drawn back screaming by their,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,nurses.,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,At mid-day young women walk out into the air. All the men are busy in,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

5670,"Elmer. The women stand round the pond, beating off great prancing shaggy",Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf
5670,dogs. Gently the baby is rocked in the perambulator. The eyes of all the,Jacob's Room,Virginia Woolf

63107,"so, said it perfectly--dear old Hugh, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"with amusement, with gratitude, with emotion, how shy, like a",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,brother--one would rather die than speak to one's brother--Hugh had,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"always been, when he was at Oxford, and came over, and perhaps one of",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,them (drat the thing!) couldn't ride. How then could women sit in,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,Parliament? How could they do things with men? For there is this,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"extraordinarily deep instinct, something inside one; you can't get over",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,it; it's no use trying; and men like Hugh respect it without our saying,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,"billowing motherliness, amplitude and homeliness, always ridiculous, yet",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"how sublime, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering Kensington Gardens and",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,the old lady in horn spectacles and being told by Nanny to stop dead,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,still and bow to the Queen. The flag flew above the Palace. The King and,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,Queen were back then. Dick had met her at lunch the other day--a,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"thoroughly nice woman. It matters so much to the poor, thought Clarissa,",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,and to the soldiers. A man in bronze stood heroically on a pedestal with,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"a gun on her left hand side--the South African war. It matters, thought",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,Mrs Dalloway walking towards Buckingham Palace. There it stood,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"four-square, in the broad sunshine, uncompromising, plain. But it was",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,character she thought; something inborn in the race; what Indians,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"respected. The Queen went to hospitals, opened bazaars--the Queen of",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"England, thought Clarissa, looking at the Palace. Already at this hour a",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,motor car passed out at the gates; soldiers saluted; the gates were,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,"picked up a crumpled paper, spread it out flat and flung it away. How",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"horrible! Last night at the Embassy Sir Dighton had said ""If I want a",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,"exquisite--pink and orange stars, paste, Spanish, she thought, and",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"chains of old gold; starry buckles, little brooches which had been worn",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,"was not the girl she remembered? She looked quite old. ""These really",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"don't fit"" said Clarissa. The shop girl looked at them. ""Madame wears",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,would adore her. The lady shook her head sadly. Again the gloves were,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,"mournfully, raising her voice. And she would have to order chairs, ices,",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,"flowers, and cloak-room tickets, thought Clarissa. The people she didn't",Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,want would come; the others wouldn't. She would stand by the door. They,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
63107,sold stockings--silk stockings. A lady is known by her gloves and her,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,half an inch longer? Still it seemed tiresome to bother her--perhaps the,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf

63107,remembered how on their honeymoon Dick had shown her the folly of giving,Mrs Dalloway,Virginia Woolf
