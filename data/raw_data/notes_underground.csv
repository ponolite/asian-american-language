600,I,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my",Notes from the Underground
600,"disease, and do not know for certain what ails me. I don’t consult a",Notes from the Underground
600,"doctor for it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and",Notes from the Underground
600,"doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to",Notes from the Underground
600,"respect medicine, anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be",Notes from the Underground
600,"superstitious, but I am superstitious). No, I refuse to consult a",Notes from the Underground
600,"doctor from spite. That you probably will not understand. Well, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"understand it, though. Of course, I can’t explain who it is precisely",Notes from the Underground
600,that I am mortifying in this case by my spite: I am perfectly well,Notes from the Underground
600,aware that I cannot “pay out” the doctors by not consulting them; I,Notes from the Underground
600,know better than anyone that by all this I am only injuring myself and,Notes from the Underground
600,"no one else. But still, if I don’t consult a doctor it is from spite.",Notes from the Underground
600,"My liver is bad, well—let it get worse!",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I have been going on like that for a long time—twenty years. Now I am,Notes from the Underground
600,"forty. I used to be in the government service, but am no longer. I was",Notes from the Underground
600,a spiteful official. I was rude and took pleasure in being so. I did,Notes from the Underground
600,"not take bribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that,",Notes from the Underground
600,"at least. (A poor jest, but I will not scratch it out. I wrote it",Notes from the Underground
600,thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself,Notes from the Underground
600,"that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch",Notes from the Underground
600,it out on purpose!),Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I,Notes from the Underground
600,"sat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when",Notes from the Underground
600,I succeeded in making anybody unhappy. I almost did succeed. For the,Notes from the Underground
600,"most part they were all timid people—of course, they were petitioners.",Notes from the Underground
600,But of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not,Notes from the Underground
600,"endure. He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a",Notes from the Underground
600,disgusting way. I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over,Notes from the Underground
600,that sword. At last I got the better of him. He left off clanking it.,Notes from the Underground
600,"That happened in my youth, though.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?",Notes from the Underground
600,"Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that",Notes from the Underground
600,"continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly",Notes from the Underground
600,conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an,Notes from the Underground
600,"embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and",Notes from the Underground
600,"amusing myself by it. I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to",Notes from the Underground
600,"play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be",Notes from the Underground
600,"appeased. I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should",Notes from the Underground
600,grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame,Notes from the Underground
600,for months after. That was my way.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official. I was,Notes from the Underground
600,lying from spite. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and,Notes from the Underground
600,"with the officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful. I was",Notes from the Underground
600,"conscious every moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely",Notes from the Underground
600,"opposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite",Notes from the Underground
600,elements. I knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and,Notes from the Underground
600,"craving some outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let",Notes from the Underground
600,"them, purposely would not let them come out. They tormented me till I",Notes from the Underground
600,"was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and—sickened me, at last, how",Notes from the Underground
600,"they sickened me! Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am",Notes from the Underground
600,"expressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness",Notes from the Underground
600,"for something? I am sure you are fancying that ... However, I assure",Notes from the Underground
600,you I do not care if you are....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to",Notes from the Underground
600,"become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an",Notes from the Underground
600,"honest man, neither a hero nor an insect. Now, I am living out my life",Notes from the Underground
600,"in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation",Notes from the Underground
600,"that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is",Notes from the Underground
600,"only the fool who becomes anything. Yes, a man in the nineteenth",Notes from the Underground
600,century must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless,Notes from the Underground
600,"creature; a man of character, an active man is pre-eminently a limited",Notes from the Underground
600,creature. That is my conviction of forty years. I am forty years old,Notes from the Underground
600,"now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is",Notes from the Underground
600,"extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is",Notes from the Underground
600,"vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and",Notes from the Underground
600,honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell,Notes from the Underground
600,"all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these",Notes from the Underground
600,silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its,Notes from the Underground
600,"face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty",Notes from the Underground
600,"myself. To seventy! To eighty! ... Stay, let me take breath ...",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you. You are",Notes from the Underground
600,"mistaken in that, too. I am by no means such a mirthful person as you",Notes from the Underground
600,"imagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble",Notes from the Underground
600,(and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I,Notes from the Underground
600,"am—then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor. I was in the service",Notes from the Underground
600,"that I might have something to eat (and solely for that reason), and",Notes from the Underground
600,when last year a distant relation left me six thousand roubles in his,Notes from the Underground
600,will I immediately retired from the service and settled down in my,Notes from the Underground
600,"corner. I used to live in this corner before, but now I have settled",Notes from the Underground
600,"down in it. My room is a wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the",Notes from the Underground
600,"town. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured from stupidity,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that",Notes from the Underground
600,"the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it",Notes from the Underground
600,is very expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all that better than,Notes from the Underground
600,all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors.... But I am,Notes from the Underground
600,remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not,Notes from the Underground
600,"going away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I",Notes from the Underground
600,am going away or not going away.,Notes from the Underground

600,II,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not,",Notes from the Underground
600,"why I could not even become an insect. I tell you solemnly, that I have",Notes from the Underground
600,many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that.,Notes from the Underground
600,"I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness—a real",Notes from the Underground
600,"thorough-going illness. For man’s everyday needs, it would have been",Notes from the Underground
600,"quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or",Notes from the Underground
600,a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of,Notes from the Underground
600,"our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal",Notes from the Underground
600,"ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional",Notes from the Underground
600,town on the whole terrestrial globe. (There are intentional and,Notes from the Underground
600,"unintentional towns.) It would have been quite enough, for instance, to",Notes from the Underground
600,have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men of,Notes from the Underground
600,"action live. I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to",Notes from the Underground
600,"be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is more, that from",Notes from the Underground
600,"ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer. But,",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger",Notes from the Underground
600,over them?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on",Notes from the Underground
600,"their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone. We will not dispute",Notes from the Underground
600,it; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a,Notes from the Underground
600,"great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a",Notes from the Underground
600,"disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me",Notes from the Underground
600,"this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments",Notes from the Underground
600,when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is,Notes from the Underground
600,"“sublime and beautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as",Notes from the Underground
600,"though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly",Notes from the Underground
600,"things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps,",Notes from the Underground
600,"commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time",Notes from the Underground
600,when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more,Notes from the Underground
600,conscious I was of goodness and of all that was “sublime and,Notes from the Underground
600,"beautiful,” the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I",Notes from the Underground
600,was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this,Notes from the Underground
600,"was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to",Notes from the Underground
600,"be so. It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in",Notes from the Underground
600,"the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to",Notes from the Underground
600,struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing,Notes from the Underground
600,(perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition.,Notes from the Underground
600,"But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that",Notes from the Underground
600,"struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all",Notes from the Underground
600,my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even,Notes from the Underground
600,"now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of",Notes from the Underground
600,"secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on",Notes from the Underground
600,"some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had",Notes from the Underground
600,"committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be",Notes from the Underground
600,"undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it,",Notes from the Underground
600,tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a,Notes from the Underground
600,"sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real",Notes from the Underground
600,"enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I",Notes from the Underground
600,have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether,Notes from the Underground
600,other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was,Notes from the Underground
600,just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it,Notes from the Underground
600,"was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it",Notes from the Underground
600,"was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no",Notes from the Underground
600,escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even,Notes from the Underground
600,if time and faith were still left you to change into something,Notes from the Underground
600,different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish,Notes from the Underground
600,"to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there",Notes from the Underground
600,was nothing for you to change into.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in",Notes from the Underground
600,"accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that",Notes from the Underground
600,consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely,Notes from the Underground
600,"nothing. Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,",Notes from the Underground
600,that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any,Notes from the Underground
600,consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he,Notes from the Underground
600,"actually is a scoundrel. But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of",Notes from the Underground
600,"nonsense, but what have I explained? How is enjoyment in this to be",Notes from the Underground
600,explained? But I will explain it. I will get to the bottom of it! That,Notes from the Underground
600,is why I have taken up my pen....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I, for instance, have a great deal of _amour propre_. I am as",Notes from the Underground
600,suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf. But upon,Notes from the Underground
600,my word I sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be,Notes from the Underground
600,"slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.",Notes from the Underground
600,"I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover",Notes from the Underground
600,"even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments,",Notes from the Underground
600,especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of,Notes from the Underground
600,one’s position. And when one is slapped in the face—why then the,Notes from the Underground
600,consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm,Notes from the Underground
600,"one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns",Notes from the Underground
600,out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most,Notes from the Underground
600,"humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say,",Notes from the Underground
600,"through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am",Notes from the Underground
600,cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always,Notes from the Underground
600,"considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At",Notes from the Underground
600,"any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never",Notes from the Underground
600,"could look people straight in the face.) To blame, finally, because",Notes from the Underground
600,"even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering",Notes from the Underground
600,from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been,Notes from the Underground
600,"able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive, for my",Notes from the Underground
600,"assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it",Notes from the Underground
600,"were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had",Notes from the Underground
600,"desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not",Notes from the Underground
600,have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly,Notes from the Underground
600,"never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to.",Notes from the Underground
600,Why should I not have made up my mind? About that in particular I want,Notes from the Underground
600,to say a few words.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,III,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for,Notes from the Underground
600,"themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed,",Notes from the Underground
600,"let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is",Notes from the Underground
600,nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a,Notes from the Underground
600,gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull,Notes from the Underground
600,"with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way:",Notes from the Underground
600,"facing the wall, such gentlemen—that is, the “direct” persons and men",Notes from the Underground
600,"of action—are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion,",Notes from the Underground
600,as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an,Notes from the Underground
600,"excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad,",Notes from the Underground
600,"though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are",Notes from the Underground
600,nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something,Notes from the Underground
600,"tranquillising, morally soothing, final—maybe even something mysterious",Notes from the Underground
600,... but of the wall later.),Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his",Notes from the Underground
600,tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him,Notes from the Underground
600,into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face.,Notes from the Underground
600,"He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man",Notes from the Underground
600,"should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in",Notes from the Underground
600,"fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it",Notes from the Underground
600,"so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the",Notes from the Underground
600,"normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is",Notes from the Underground
600,"almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made",Notes from the Underground
600,man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that,Notes from the Underground
600,with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself,Notes from the Underground
600,"as a mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it",Notes from the Underground
600,"is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et",Notes from the Underground
600,"caetera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks",Notes from the Underground
600,on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an,Notes from the Underground
600,important point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us,Notes from the Underground
600,"suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost",Notes from the Underground
600,"always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may",Notes from the Underground
600,even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in _l’homme de la,Notes from the Underground
600,nature et de la vérité_. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite,Notes from the Underground
600,on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in,Notes from the Underground
600,_l’homme de la nature et de la vérité_. For through his innate,Notes from the Underground
600,stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple;,Notes from the Underground
600,while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not,Notes from the Underground
600,"believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to",Notes from the Underground
600,the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the,Notes from the Underground
600,luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses,Notes from the Underground
600,"in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many",Notes from the Underground
600,unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of,Notes from the Underground
600,"fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of",Notes from the Underground
600,the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand,Notes from the Underground
600,"solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their",Notes from the Underground
600,healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss,Notes from the Underground
600,"all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt",Notes from the Underground
600,"in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its",Notes from the Underground
600,"mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our",Notes from the Underground
600,"insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in",Notes from the Underground
600,"cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years",Notes from the Underground
600,"together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most",Notes from the Underground
600,"ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still",Notes from the Underground
600,"more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own",Notes from the Underground
600,"imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it",Notes from the Underground
600,"will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will",Notes from the Underground
600,"invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things",Notes from the Underground
600,"might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge",Notes from the Underground
600,"itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind",Notes from the Underground
600,"the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to",Notes from the Underground
600,"vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its",Notes from the Underground
600,efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom,Notes from the Underground
600,"it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself.",Notes from the Underground
600,"On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest",Notes from the Underground
600,accumulated over all the years and ...,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in",Notes from the Underground
600,that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for,Notes from the Underground
600,"forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful",Notes from the Underground
600,"hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires",Notes from the Underground
600,"turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined",Notes from the Underground
600,for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that,Notes from the Underground
600,"strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so",Notes from the Underground
600,"difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even",Notes from the Underground
600,"simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of",Notes from the Underground
600,"it. “Possibly,” you will add on your own account with a grin, “people",Notes from the Underground
600,will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the,Notes from the Underground
600,"face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,",Notes from the Underground
600,"perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and",Notes from the Underground
600,so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set,Notes from the Underground
600,"your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face,",Notes from the Underground
600,though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may,Notes from the Underground
600,"think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so",Notes from the Underground
600,few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word,Notes from the Underground
600,on that subject of such extreme interest to you.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not,Notes from the Underground
600,understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain,Notes from the Underground
600,"circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though",Notes from the Underground
600,"this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have",Notes from the Underground
600,"said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The",Notes from the Underground
600,"impossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the",Notes from the Underground
600,"laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon",Notes from the Underground
600,"as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a",Notes from the Underground
600,"monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they",Notes from the Underground

600,"are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans,",Notes from the Underground
600,"they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The",Notes from the Underground

600,"not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan. It is a good example,",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans express in the first",Notes from the Underground

600,consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit,Notes from the Underground

600,"mortal insults, these jeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last",Notes from the Underground
600,in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of,Notes from the Underground

600,"an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on",Notes from the Underground
600,"the second or third day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan,",Notes from the Underground
600,"not as he moaned on the first day, that is, not simply because he has",Notes from the Underground
600,"toothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by",Notes from the Underground
600,"progress and European civilisation, a man who is “divorced from the",Notes from the Underground
600,"soil and the national elements,” as they express it now-a-days. His",Notes from the Underground
600,"moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days",Notes from the Underground
600,and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no,Notes from the Underground
600,sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is,Notes from the Underground
600,only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows,Notes from the Underground
600,"that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his",Notes from the Underground
600,"whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha’porth of",Notes from the Underground
600,"faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,",Notes from the Underground
600,"more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing",Notes from the Underground
600,"himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these",Notes from the Underground
600,recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure.,Notes from the Underground
600,"As though he would say: “I am worrying you, I am lacerating your",Notes from the Underground

600,"then, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache. I am not a",Notes from the Underground

600,"not saying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse. And, indeed, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"could never endure saying, “Forgive me, Papa, I won’t do it again,” not",Notes from the Underground
600,"because I am incapable of saying that—on the contrary, perhaps just",Notes from the Underground
600,"because I have been too capable of it, and in what a way, too. As",Notes from the Underground
600,though of design I used to get into trouble in cases when I was not to,Notes from the Underground
600,blame in any way. That was the nastiest part of it. At the same time I,Notes from the Underground
600,"was genuinely touched and penitent, I used to shed tears and, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"course, deceived myself, though I was not acting in the least and there",Notes from the Underground
600,was a sick feeling in my heart at the time.... For that one could not,Notes from the Underground
600,"blame even the laws of nature, though the laws of nature have",Notes from the Underground
600,continually all my life offended me more than anything. It is loathsome,Notes from the Underground
600,"to remember it all, but it was loathsome even then. Of course, a minute",Notes from the Underground
600,"or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a",Notes from the Underground
600,"revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this",Notes from the Underground
600,"emotion, these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with",Notes from the Underground
600,"such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one’s hands",Notes from the Underground
600,"folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe",Notes from the Underground
600,"yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it",Notes from the Underground
600,"is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at",Notes from the Underground
600,"least to live in some way. How many times it has happened to me—well,",Notes from the Underground
600,"for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one",Notes from the Underground
600,"knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is",Notes from the Underground
600,"putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being",Notes from the Underground
600,"really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks,",Notes from the Underground
600,"so that in the end I could not control it in myself. Another time,",Notes from the Underground
600,"twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen,",Notes from the Underground
600,I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my,Notes from the Underground
600,"suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in",Notes from the Underground
600,"the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all",Notes from the Underground
600,"from _ennui_, gentlemen, all from _ennui;_ inertia overcame me. You",Notes from the Underground
600,"know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is,",Notes from the Underground
600,conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this,Notes from the Underground
600,"already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and men",Notes from the Underground
600,of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How,Notes from the Underground
600,explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they,Notes from the Underground
600,"take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way",Notes from the Underground
600,persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that,Notes from the Underground
600,"they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their",Notes from the Underground
600,minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to,Notes from the Underground
600,"act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no",Notes from the Underground
600,"trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind",Notes from the Underground
600,at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are,Notes from the Underground
600,my foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in,Notes from the Underground
600,"reflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws",Notes from the Underground
600,"after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is",Notes from the Underground
600,just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must,Notes from the Underground
600,be a case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the,Notes from the Underground
600,"end? Why, just the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am",Notes from the Underground
600,sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself,Notes from the Underground
600,"because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause,",Notes from the Underground
600,"that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently",Notes from the Underground
600,"he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded",Notes from the Underground
600,"that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to",Notes from the Underground
600,"revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might",Notes from the Underground
600,"overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite",Notes from the Underground
600,"successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a",Notes from the Underground
600,cause. But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with,Notes from the Underground
600,"that just now, you know). In consequence again of those accursed laws",Notes from the Underground
600,"of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration.",Notes from the Underground
600,"You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons",Notes from the Underground
600,"evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a",Notes from the Underground
600,"wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is",Notes from the Underground
600,"to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left",Notes from the Underground
600,"again—that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up",Notes from the Underground
600,with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause.,Notes from the Underground
600,"And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly,",Notes from the Underground
600,"without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at",Notes from the Underground
600,"least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands",Notes from the Underground
600,"folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising",Notes from the Underground
600,yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble,Notes from the Underground
600,"and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an",Notes from the Underground
600,"intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to",Notes from the Underground
600,"begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless",Notes from the Underground
600,"vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct",Notes from the Underground

600,very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean,Notes from the Underground
600,"that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was something",Notes from the Underground
600,"to say about me. “Sluggard”—why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a",Notes from the Underground
600,"career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best",Notes from the Underground
600,"club by right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting",Notes from the Underground
600,myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a,Notes from the Underground
600,"connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a",Notes from the Underground
600,"triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have",Notes from the Underground
600,"chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a",Notes from the Underground
600,"glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for",Notes from the Underground
600,everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had,Notes from the Underground
600,visions of it. That “sublime and beautiful” weighs heavily on my mind,Notes from the Underground
600,"at forty But that is at forty; then—oh, then it would have been",Notes from the Underground
600,different! I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping,Notes from the Underground
600,"with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything “sublime",Notes from the Underground
600,and beautiful.” I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a,Notes from the Underground
600,tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is “sublime and,Notes from the Underground
600,beautiful.” I should then have turned everything into the sublime and,Notes from the Underground
600,"the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have",Notes from the Underground
600,sought out the sublime and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears,Notes from the Underground
600,"like a wet sponge. An artist, for instance, paints a picture worthy of",Notes from the Underground
600,Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who painted the,Notes from the Underground
600,"picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is “sublime and",Notes from the Underground

600,you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the,Notes from the Underground

600,"advantage, _sometimes_, not only may, but even must, consist in his",Notes from the Underground
600,desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not,Notes from the Underground
600,"advantageous. And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole",Notes from the Underground
600,principle falls into dust. What do you think—are there such cases? You,Notes from the Underground
600,"laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man’s advantages",Notes from the Underground
600,been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not,Notes from the Underground
600,only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any,Notes from the Underground
600,"classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my",Notes from the Underground
600,"knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the",Notes from the Underground
600,averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your,Notes from the Underground
600,"advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace—and so on, and so on.",Notes from the Underground
600,"So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in",Notes from the Underground
600,"opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine,",Notes from the Underground
600,"too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he?",Notes from the Underground
600,"But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that",Notes from the Underground
600,"all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon",Notes from the Underground
600,up human advantages invariably leave out one? They don’t even take it,Notes from the Underground
600,"into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the",Notes from the Underground
600,"whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no greater matter, they",Notes from the Underground
600,"would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list.",Notes from the Underground
600,"But the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any",Notes from the Underground
600,classification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for,Notes from the Underground
600,"instance ... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and",Notes from the Underground
600,"indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend! When he",Notes from the Underground
600,prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to,Notes from the Underground
600,"you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with",Notes from the Underground
600,"the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with",Notes from the Underground
600,excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony,Notes from the Underground
600,he will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own,Notes from the Underground
600,"interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter",Notes from the Underground
600,"of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through",Notes from the Underground
600,"something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will",Notes from the Underground
600,"go off on quite a different tack—that is, act in direct opposition to",Notes from the Underground
600,"what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws",Notes from the Underground
600,"of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to",Notes from the Underground
600,everything ... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and,Notes from the Underground
600,"therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is,",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to",Notes from the Underground
600,"almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)",Notes from the Underground
600,there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which,Notes from the Underground
600,we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than,Notes from the Underground
600,"all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready",Notes from the Underground
600,"to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason,",Notes from the Underground
600,"honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent",Notes from the Underground
600,"and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most",Notes from the Underground
600,"advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. “Yes, but it’s",Notes from the Underground
600,"advantage all the same,” you will retort. But excuse me, I’ll make the",Notes from the Underground
600,"point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters",Notes from the Underground
600,"is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks",Notes from the Underground
600,"down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system",Notes from the Underground
600,"constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact,",Notes from the Underground
600,"it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare",Notes from the Underground
600,"that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to",Notes from the Underground
600,"mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving",Notes from the Underground
600,"to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble—are,",Notes from the Underground
600,"in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of",Notes from the Underground
600,the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing,Notes from the Underground
600,"... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through",Notes from the Underground
600,"civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty",Notes from the Underground
600,and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his,Notes from the Underground
600,arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract,Notes from the Underground
600,"deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is",Notes from the Underground
600,ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I,Notes from the Underground
600,take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only,Notes from the Underground
600,"look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest",Notes from the Underground
600,"way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth",Notes from the Underground
600,century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon—the Great and also the,Notes from the Underground
600,present one. Take North America—the eternal union. Take the farce of,Notes from the Underground
600,Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that civilisation softens in us?,Notes from the Underground
600,The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for,Notes from the Underground
600,variety of sensations—and absolutely nothing more. And through the,Notes from the Underground
600,development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in,Notes from the Underground
600,"bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed",Notes from the Underground
600,that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest,Notes from the Underground
600,"slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a",Notes from the Underground
600,"candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka",Notes from the Underground
600,"Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary",Notes from the Underground
600,and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made,Notes from the Underground
600,"mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more",Notes from the Underground
600,loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and,Notes from the Underground
600,with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now,Notes from the Underground
600,"we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination,",Notes from the Underground
600,and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for,Notes from the Underground
600,yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman,Notes from the Underground
600,history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls’ breasts,Notes from the Underground
600,and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will,Notes from the Underground
600,say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are,Notes from the Underground
600,"barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are",Notes from the Underground
600,stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly,Notes from the Underground
600,"than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as",Notes from the Underground
600,reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that,Notes from the Underground
600,"he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits,",Notes from the Underground
600,and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human,Notes from the Underground
600,nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then,Notes from the Underground
600,"man will cease from _intentional_ error and will, so to say, be",Notes from the Underground
600,compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests.,Notes from the Underground
600,"That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though",Notes from the Underground
600,to my mind it’s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any,Notes from the Underground
600,"caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the",Notes from the Underground
600,"nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are,",Notes from the Underground
600,"besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does",Notes from the Underground
600,"is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of",Notes from the Underground
600,"nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and",Notes from the Underground
600,man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become,Notes from the Underground
600,"exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be",Notes from the Underground
600,"tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of",Notes from the Underground
600,"logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still,",Notes from the Underground
600,there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of,Notes from the Underground
600,"encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly",Notes from the Underground
600,calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or,Notes from the Underground
600,adventures in the world.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be,Notes from the Underground
600,"established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical",Notes from the Underground
600,"exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the",Notes from the Underground
600,"twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be",Notes from the Underground
600,"provided. Then the “Palace of Crystal” will be built. Then ... In fact,",Notes from the Underground
600,those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is,Notes from the Underground
600,"my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then",Notes from the Underground
600,(for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and,Notes from the Underground
600,"tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily",Notes from the Underground
600,rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom,Notes from the Underground
600,"sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not",Notes from the Underground
600,matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say,Notes from the Underground
600,"people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you",Notes from the Underground
600,"know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is",Notes from the Underground
600,so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation.,Notes from the Underground
600,"I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a",Notes from the Underground
600,"sudden, _à propos_ of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical,",Notes from the Underground
600,"countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all:",Notes from the Underground
600,"“I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and",Notes from the Underground
600,"scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to",Notes from the Underground
600,"the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish",Notes from the Underground
600,"will!” That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he",Notes from the Underground
600,would be sure to find followers—such is the nature of man. And all that,Notes from the Underground
600,"for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth",Notes from the Underground
600,"mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he",Notes from the Underground
600,"may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his",Notes from the Underground
600,reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to,Notes from the Underground
600,"one’s own interests, and sometimes one _positively ought_ (that is my",Notes from the Underground
600,"idea). One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s own caprice, however",Notes from the Underground
600,"wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that",Notes from the Underground
600,"very “most advantageous advantage” which we have overlooked, which",Notes from the Underground
600,comes under no classification and against which all systems and,Notes from the Underground
600,theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these,Notes from the Underground
600,"wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has",Notes from the Underground
600,made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice?,Notes from the Underground
600,"What man wants is simply _independent_ choice, whatever that",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was",Notes from the Underground
600,rather frightened. I was just going to say that the devil only knows,Notes from the Underground
600,"what choice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing,",Notes from the Underground
600,but I remembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up. And,Notes from the Underground
600,"here you have begun upon it. Indeed, if there really is some day",Notes from the Underground
600,"discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices—that is, an",Notes from the Underground
600,"explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they",Notes from the Underground
600,"develop, what they are aiming at in one case and in another and so on,",Notes from the Underground
600,"that is a real mathematical formula—then, most likely, man will at once",Notes from the Underground
600,"cease to feel desire, indeed, he will be certain to. For who would want",Notes from the Underground
600,"to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human",Notes from the Underground
600,being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man,Notes from the Underground
600,"without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in",Notes from the Underground
600,an organ? What do you think? Let us reckon the chances—can such a thing,Notes from the Underground
600,happen or not?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“H’m!” you decide. “Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view of,Notes from the Underground
600,our advantage. We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our,Notes from the Underground
600,foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a,Notes from the Underground
600,supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on,Notes from the Underground
600,"paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and",Notes from the Underground
600,senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never,Notes from the Underground
600,"understand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For",Notes from the Underground
600,if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason,Notes from the Underground
600,"and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to",Notes from the Underground
600,"be _senseless_ in our desires, and in that way knowingly act against",Notes from the Underground
600,reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning,Notes from the Underground
600,can be really calculated—because there will some day be discovered the,Notes from the Underground
600,"laws of our so-called free will—so, joking apart, there may one day be",Notes from the Underground
600,"something like a table constructed of them, so that we really shall",Notes from the Underground
600,"choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate",Notes from the Underground
600,and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not,Notes from the Underground
600,help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that,Notes from the Underground
600,"particular way, what _freedom_ is left me, especially if I am a learned",Notes from the Underground
600,man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to,Notes from the Underground
600,"calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this",Notes from the Underground
600,"could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we",Notes from the Underground
600,"should have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to",Notes from the Underground
600,repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such,Notes from the Underground
600,circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take,Notes from the Underground
600,"her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really",Notes from the Underground
600,"aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the",Notes from the Underground
600,"chemical retort, there’s no help for it, we must accept the retort too,",Notes from the Underground
600,or else it will be accepted without our consent....”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being",Notes from the Underground
600,over-philosophical; it’s the result of forty years underground! Allow,Notes from the Underground
600,"me to indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent",Notes from the Underground
600,"thing, there’s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and",Notes from the Underground
600,"satisfies only the rational side of man’s nature, while will is a",Notes from the Underground
600,"manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life",Notes from the Underground
600,"including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this",Notes from the Underground
600,"manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply",Notes from the Underground
600,"extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to",Notes from the Underground
600,"live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my",Notes from the Underground
600,"capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my",Notes from the Underground
600,capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has,Notes from the Underground
600,"succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this",Notes from the Underground
600,"is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts",Notes from the Underground
600,"as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or",Notes from the Underground
600,"unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect,",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me",Notes from the Underground
600,"again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the",Notes from the Underground
600,"future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous",Notes from the Underground
600,"to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree,",Notes from the Underground
600,"it can—by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is",Notes from the Underground
600,"one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is",Notes from the Underground
600,"injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to",Notes from the Underground
600,have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not,Notes from the Underground
600,to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of,Notes from the Underground
600,"course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in",Notes from the Underground
600,"reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on",Notes from the Underground
600,"earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more",Notes from the Underground
600,"advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and",Notes from the Underground
600,contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our,Notes from the Underground
600,advantage—for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most,Notes from the Underground
600,"precious and most important—that is, our personality, our",Notes from the Underground
600,"individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most",Notes from the Underground
600,"precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in",Notes from the Underground
600,agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept,Notes from the Underground
600,within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But,Notes from the Underground
600,"very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly",Notes from the Underground
600,"opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is",Notes from the Underground
600,"profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that",Notes from the Underground
600,"man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only",Notes from the Underground
600,"from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?)",Notes from the Underground
600,"But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally",Notes from the Underground
600,"ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the",Notes from the Underground
600,"ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect;",Notes from the Underground
600,"his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual—from the",Notes from the Underground
600,days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and,Notes from the Underground
600,consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that,Notes from the Underground
600,lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put,Notes from the Underground
600,it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What,Notes from the Underground
600,"will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the",Notes from the Underground
600,"Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that’s worth something. With good",Notes from the Underground
600,reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work,Notes from the Underground
600,"of man’s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by",Notes from the Underground
600,"nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too:",Notes from the Underground
600,"if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples",Notes from the Underground
600,"in all ages—that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress",Notes from the Underground
600,uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be,Notes from the Underground
600,equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it’s monotonous too: it’s,Notes from the Underground
600,"fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and",Notes from the Underground
600,"they fought last—you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In",Notes from the Underground
600,"short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything",Notes from the Underground
600,that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one,Notes from the Underground
600,can’t say is that it’s rational. The very word sticks in one’s throat.,Notes from the Underground
600,"And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there",Notes from the Underground
600,"are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages",Notes from the Underground
600,and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives,Notes from the Underground
600,"as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to",Notes from the Underground
600,their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to,Notes from the Underground
600,live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that,Notes from the Underground
600,"those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves,",Notes from the Underground
600,"playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you:",Notes from the Underground
600,what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange,Notes from the Underground
600,"qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea",Notes from the Underground
600,"of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the",Notes from the Underground
600,"surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing",Notes from the Underground
600,"else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation",Notes from the Underground
600,"of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite,",Notes from the Underground
600,man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and,Notes from the Underground
600,"would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical",Notes from the Underground
600,"absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his",Notes from the Underground
600,"fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar",Notes from the Underground
600,"folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to",Notes from the Underground
600,himself—as though that were so necessary—that men still are men and not,Notes from the Underground
600,"the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so",Notes from the Underground
600,completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the,Notes from the Underground
600,calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a,Notes from the Underground
600,"piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and",Notes from the Underground
600,"mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would",Notes from the Underground
600,"purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to",Notes from the Underground
600,gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive,Notes from the Underground
600,"destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to",Notes from the Underground
600,"gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man",Notes from the Underground
600,"can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and",Notes from the Underground
600,"other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his",Notes from the Underground
600,"object—that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key!",Notes from the Underground
600,"If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated—chaos",Notes from the Underground
600,"and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it",Notes from the Underground
600,"all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself,",Notes from the Underground
600,then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain,Notes from the Underground
600,"his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man",Notes from the Underground
600,really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute,Notes from the Underground
600,that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his,Notes from the Underground

600,"questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of",Notes from the Underground
600,their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and,Notes from the Underground

600,that it is _desirable_ to reform man in that way? And what leads you to,Notes from the Underground
600,"the conclusion that man’s inclinations _need_ reforming? In short, how",Notes from the Underground
600,do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go,Notes from the Underground
600,"to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not",Notes from the Underground
600,to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions,Notes from the Underground
600,of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and,Notes from the Underground
600,"must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your",Notes from the Underground
600,"supposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity.",Notes from the Underground
600,"You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself.",Notes from the Underground
600,"I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to",Notes from the Underground
600,"strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering—that is,",Notes from the Underground
600,"incessantly and eternally to make new roads, _wherever they may lead_.",Notes from the Underground
600,But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just,Notes from the Underground
600,"be that he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that",Notes from the Underground
600,"however stupid the “direct” practical man may be, the thought sometimes",Notes from the Underground
600,"will occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_,",Notes from the Underground
600,and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process,Notes from the Underground
600,"of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted",Notes from the Underground
600,"child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal",Notes from the Underground
600,"idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man",Notes from the Underground
600,"likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But",Notes from the Underground
600,why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell,Notes from the Underground
600,me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May,Notes from the Underground
600,it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no,Notes from the Underground
600,disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively,Notes from the Underground
600,afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is,Notes from the Underground
600,"constructing? Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a",Notes from the Underground
600,"distance, and is by no means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps",Notes from the Underground
600,"he only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will",Notes from the Underground
600,"leave it, when completed, for the use of _les animaux domestiques_—such",Notes from the Underground
600,"as the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite a different",Notes from the Underground

600,With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the,Notes from the Underground

600,"is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other",Notes from the Underground
600,"words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must",Notes from the Underground
600,"always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of",Notes from the Underground
600,"death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical",Notes from the Underground
600,"certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but",Notes from the Underground
600,"seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his",Notes from the Underground
600,"life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I assure",Notes from the Underground
600,you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him,Notes from the Underground
600,to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least,Notes from the Underground
600,"receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the",Notes from the Underground
600,police-station—and there is occupation for a week. But where can man,Notes from the Underground
600,"go? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has",Notes from the Underground
600,"attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not",Notes from the Underground
600,"quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In",Notes from the Underground
600,"fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it",Notes from the Underground
600,"all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all, something",Notes from the Underground
600,insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of,Notes from the Underground
600,insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms,Notes from the Underground
600,akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes,Notes from the Underground
600,"four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due,",Notes from the Underground
600,twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the",Notes from the Underground
600,"normal and the positive—in other words, only what is conducive to",Notes from the Underground
600,welfare—is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards,Notes from the Underground
600,"advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?",Notes from the Underground
600,Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as,Notes from the Underground
600,"great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily,",Notes from the Underground
600,"passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no",Notes from the Underground
600,"need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself,",Notes from the Underground
600,if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion,Notes from the Underground
600,"is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively",Notes from the Underground
600,"ill-bred. Whether it’s good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too,",Notes from the Underground
600,to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being,Notes from the Underground
600,"either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed",Notes from the Underground
600,"to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles,",Notes from the Underground
600,for instance; I know that. In the “Palace of Crystal” it is,Notes from the Underground
600,"unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the",Notes from the Underground
600,good of a “palace of crystal” if there could be any doubt about it? And,Notes from the Underground
600,"yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is,",Notes from the Underground
600,"destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of",Notes from the Underground
600,consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that,Notes from the Underground
600,"consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes",Notes from the Underground
600,"it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. Consciousness, for",Notes from the Underground
600,"instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have",Notes from the Underground
600,mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand.,Notes from the Underground
600,There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge,Notes from the Underground
600,"into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though",Notes from the Underground
600,"the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is,",Notes from the Underground
600,corporal punishment is better than nothing.,Notes from the Underground

600,You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed—a palace,Notes from the Underground
600,at which one will not be able to put out one’s tongue or make a long,Notes from the Underground
600,nose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this,Notes from the Underground
600,"edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one",Notes from the Underground
600,cannot put one’s tongue out at it even on the sly.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into",Notes from the Underground
600,"it to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a",Notes from the Underground
600,palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say,Notes from the Underground
600,"that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"answer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not,Notes from the Underground
600,"the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live",Notes from the Underground
600,"in a mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it",Notes from the Underground
600,"when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with",Notes from the Underground
600,"something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a",Notes from the Underground
600,"hen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it",Notes from the Underground
600,may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have,Notes from the Underground
600,"invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned",Notes from the Underground
600,irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that,Notes from the Underground
600,it is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my,Notes from the Underground
600,"desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are",Notes from the Underground
600,laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than,Notes from the Underground
600,"pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I",Notes from the Underground
600,"will not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply",Notes from the Underground
600,because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. I,Notes from the Underground
600,will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with,Notes from the Underground
600,"tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with",Notes from the Underground
600,"a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my",Notes from the Underground
600,"ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say,",Notes from the Underground
600,"perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give",Notes from the Underground
600,you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you,Notes from the Underground
600,"won’t deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I",Notes from the Underground
600,can retreat into my underground hole.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were,Notes from the Underground
600,withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don’t remind me,Notes from the Underground
600,that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason,Notes from the Underground
600,that one cannot put out one’s tongue at it. I did not say because I am,Notes from the Underground
600,"so fond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was,",Notes from the Underground
600,that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not,Notes from the Underground
600,"put out one’s tongue. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off",Notes from the Underground
600,out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all,Notes from the Underground
600,desire to put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so,Notes from the Underground
600,"arranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats. Then why am",Notes from the Underground
600,I made with such desires? Can I have been constructed simply in order,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,that you are afraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate,Notes from the Underground
600,yourself in our good opinion. You declare that you are gnashing your,Notes from the Underground
600,teeth and at the same time you try to be witty so as to amuse us. You,Notes from the Underground
600,"know that your witticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well",Notes from the Underground

600,"impudence. You boast of consciousness, but you are not sure of your",Notes from the Underground
600,"ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is darkened and",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Of course I have myself made up all the things you say. That, too, is",Notes from the Underground

600,"a crack under the floor. I have invented them myself, there was nothing",Notes from the Underground
600,else I could invent. It is no wonder that I have learned it by heart,Notes from the Underground
600,and it has taken a literary form....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But can you really be so credulous as to think that I will print all,Notes from the Underground
600,this and give it to you to read too? And another problem: why do I call,Notes from the Underground
600,"you “gentlemen,” why do I address you as though you really were my",Notes from the Underground
600,readers? Such confessions as I intend to make are never printed nor,Notes from the Underground
600,"given to other people to read. Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough",Notes from the Underground
600,"for that, and I don’t see why I should be. But you see a fancy has",Notes from the Underground
600,occurred to me and I want to realise it at all costs. Let me explain.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone, but",Notes from the Underground
600,only to his friends. He has other matters in his mind which he would,Notes from the Underground
600,"not reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in",Notes from the Underground
600,secret. But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even,Notes from the Underground
600,"to himself, and every decent man has a number of such things stored",Notes from the Underground
600,"away in his mind. The more decent he is, the greater the number of such",Notes from the Underground
600,"things in his mind. Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember",Notes from the Underground
600,"some of my early adventures. Till now I have always avoided them, even",Notes from the Underground
600,"with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"have actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the",Notes from the Underground
600,"experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and",Notes from the Underground
600,"not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis,",Notes from the Underground
600,"that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility,",Notes from the Underground
600,and that man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau,Notes from the Underground
600,"certainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even",Notes from the Underground
600,"intentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right;",Notes from the Underground
600,"I quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity,",Notes from the Underground
600,"attribute regular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well",Notes from the Underground
600,conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of people who made their,Notes from the Underground
600,"confessions to the public. I write only for myself, and I wish to",Notes from the Underground
600,declare once and for all that if I write as though I were addressing,Notes from the Underground
600,"readers, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that",Notes from the Underground
600,"form. It is a form, an empty form—I shall never have readers. I have",Notes from the Underground
600,made this plain already ...,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I don’t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of,Notes from the Underground
600,my notes. I shall not attempt any system or method. I will jot things,Notes from the Underground
600,down as I remember them.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you",Notes from the Underground
600,"really don’t reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with",Notes from the Underground
600,"yourself—and on paper too—that is, that you won’t attempt any system or",Notes from the Underground
600,"method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on, and",Notes from the Underground
600,so on? Why are you explaining? Why do you apologise?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Well, there it is, I answer.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"There is a whole psychology in all this, though. Perhaps it is simply",Notes from the Underground
600,that I am a coward. And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience,Notes from the Underground
600,before me in order that I may be more dignified while I write. There,Notes from the Underground
600,"are perhaps thousands of reasons. Again, what is my object precisely in",Notes from the Underground
600,writing? If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not,Notes from the Underground
600,simply recall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on,Notes from the Underground
600,paper?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Quite so; but yet it is more imposing on paper. There is something more,Notes from the Underground
600,impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and,Notes from the Underground
600,"improve my style. Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from",Notes from the Underground
600,"writing. Today, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory",Notes from the Underground
600,"of a distant past. It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and",Notes from the Underground
600,has remained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid,Notes from the Underground
600,of. And yet I must get rid of it somehow. I have hundreds of such,Notes from the Underground
600,reminiscences; but at times some one stands out from the hundred and,Notes from the Underground
600,oppresses me. For some reason I believe that if I write it down I,Notes from the Underground
600,should get rid of it. Why not try?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do. Writing will be a",Notes from the Underground

600,"At that time I was only twenty-four. My life was even then gloomy,",Notes from the Underground
600,"ill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with",Notes from the Underground
600,"no one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more",Notes from the Underground
600,"in my hole. At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was",Notes from the Underground
600,"perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a",Notes from the Underground
600,"queer fellow, but even looked upon me—I always fancied this—with a sort",Notes from the Underground
600,of loathing. I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me,Notes from the Underground
600,fancied that he was looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a,Notes from the Underground
600,"most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I",Notes from the Underground
600,believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an,Notes from the Underground
600,unsightly countenance. Another had such a very dirty old uniform that,Notes from the Underground
600,there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. Yet not one of these,Notes from the Underground
600,gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness—either about their,Notes from the Underground
600,clothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of,Notes from the Underground
600,them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had,Notes from the Underground
600,imagined it they would not have minded—so long as their superiors did,Notes from the Underground
600,"not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now that, owing to my",Notes from the Underground
600,"unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often",Notes from the Underground
600,"looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone. I hated my face,",Notes from the Underground
600,"for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that there",Notes from the Underground
600,"was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up",Notes from the Underground
600,"at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to",Notes from the Underground
600,"assume a lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being",Notes from the Underground
600,"abject. “My face may be ugly,” I thought, “but let it be lofty,",Notes from the Underground
600,"expressive, and, above all, _extremely_ intelligent.” But I was",Notes from the Underground
600,positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my,Notes from the Underground
600,"countenance ever to express those qualities. And what was worst of all,",Notes from the Underground
600,"I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite",Notes from the Underground
600,"satisfied if I could have looked intelligent. In fact, I would even",Notes from the Underground
600,"have put up with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have",Notes from the Underground
600,been thought strikingly intelligent.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them",Notes from the Underground
600,"all, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact,",Notes from the Underground
600,it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself.,Notes from the Underground
600,It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising,Notes from the Underground
600,them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man,Notes from the Underground
600,"cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself,",Notes from the Underground
600,and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But,Notes from the Underground
600,whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes,Notes from the Underground
600,almost every time I met anyone. I even made experiments whether I could,Notes from the Underground
600,"face so and so’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my",Notes from the Underground
600,"eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in",Notes from the Underground
600,"everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a",Notes from the Underground
600,whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how,Notes from the Underground
600,could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age,Notes from the Underground
600,"should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many",Notes from the Underground
600,sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was,Notes from the Underground
600,"a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly",Notes from the Underground
600,"developed. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I",Notes from the Underground
600,was a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest,Notes from the Underground
600,embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a,Notes from the Underground
600,slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He,Notes from the Underground
600,is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present,Notes from the Underground
600,"time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a",Notes from the Underground
600,decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature,Notes from the Underground
600,for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them happens to,Notes from the Underground
600,"be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried away",Notes from the Underground
600,by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something,Notes from the Underground

600,"I would laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would",Notes from the Underground
600,reproach myself with being _romantic_. At one time I was unwilling to,Notes from the Underground
600,"speak to anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to",Notes from the Underground
600,the length of contemplating making friends with them. All my,Notes from the Underground
600,"fastidiousness would suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish. Who",Notes from the Underground
600,"knows, perhaps I never had really had it, and it had simply been",Notes from the Underground
600,"affected, and got out of books. I have not decided that question even",Notes from the Underground
600,"now. Once I quite made friends with them, visited their homes, played",Notes from the Underground
600,"preference, drank vodka, talked of promotions.... But here let me make",Notes from the Underground
600,a digression.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish",Notes from the Underground
600,"transcendental “romantics”—German, and still more French—on whom",Notes from the Underground
600,"nothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France",Notes from the Underground
600,"perished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would",Notes from the Underground
600,"not even have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on",Notes from the Underground
600,"singing their transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because",Notes from the Underground
600,"they are fools. We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That",Notes from the Underground
600,is what distinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently these,Notes from the Underground
600,transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The,Notes from the Underground
600,idea that they are is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of,Notes from the Underground
600,"that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr",Notes from the Underground
600,Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have,Notes from the Underground
600,"slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort",Notes from the Underground
600,"as in Germany or France. On the contrary, the characteristics of our",Notes from the Underground
600,“romantics” are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental,Notes from the Underground
600,"European type, and no European standard can be applied to them. (Allow",Notes from the Underground
600,me to make use of this word “romantic”—an old-fashioned and much,Notes from the Underground
600,respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.) The,Notes from the Underground
600,"characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, _to see",Notes from the Underground
600,everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most,Notes from the Underground
600,"realistic minds see it;_ to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at",Notes from the Underground
600,"the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from",Notes from the Underground
600,policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as,Notes from the Underground
600,"rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),",Notes from the Underground
600,to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and,Notes from the Underground
600,"volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve “the sublime",Notes from the Underground
600,"and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of their death,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel",Notes from the Underground
600,wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the sublime and the,Notes from the Underground
600,beautiful.” Our “romantic” is a man of great breadth and the greatest,Notes from the Underground
600,"rogue of all our rogues, I assure you.... I can assure you from",Notes from the Underground
600,"experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what",Notes from the Underground
600,"am I saying! The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to",Notes from the Underground
600,"observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don’t count,",Notes from the Underground
600,and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they,Notes from the Underground
600,"degenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more",Notes from the Underground

600,"Anyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it. Our romantic would rather",Notes from the Underground
600,"go out of his mind—a thing, however, which very rarely happens—than",Notes from the Underground
600,"take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is",Notes from the Underground
600,"never kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as",Notes from the Underground
600,"“the King of Spain” if he should go very mad. But it is only the thin,",Notes from the Underground
600,fair people who go out of their minds in Russia. Innumerable,Notes from the Underground
600,“romantics” attain later in life to considerable rank in the service.,Notes from the Underground
600,Their many-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for,Notes from the Underground
600,the most contradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought even,Notes from the Underground
600,"in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are",Notes from the Underground
600,so many “broad natures” among us who never lose their ideal even in the,Notes from the Underground
600,depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel—a more,Notes from the Underground
600,"decent, a more _literary_ one, so to speak. I had been treated like a",Notes from the Underground
600,"fly. This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little",Notes from the Underground
600,fellow. But the quarrel was in my hands. I had only to protest and I,Notes from the Underground
600,certainly would have been thrown out of the window. But I changed my,Notes from the Underground
600,mind and preferred to beat a resentful retreat.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground

600,"Pirogov, appealing to the police. They did not fight duels and would",Notes from the Underground
600,have thought a duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly,Notes from the Underground
600,procedure in any case—and they looked upon the duel altogether as,Notes from the Underground
600,"something impossible, something free-thinking and French. But they were",Notes from the Underground
600,"quite ready to bully, especially when they were over six foot.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded",Notes from the Underground
600,"vanity. I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound",Notes from the Underground
600,thrashing and being thrown out of the window; I should have had,Notes from the Underground
600,"physical courage enough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage.",Notes from the Underground
600,"What I was afraid of was that everyone present, from the insolent",Notes from the Underground
600,"marker down to the lowest little stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy",Notes from the Underground
600,"collar, would jeer at me and fail to understand when I began to protest",Notes from the Underground
600,and to address them in literary language. For of the point of,Notes from the Underground
600,"honour—not of honour, but of the point of honour (_point",Notes from the Underground
600,d’honneur_)—one cannot speak among us except in literary language. You,Notes from the Underground
600,can’t allude to the “point of honour” in ordinary language. I was fully,Notes from the Underground
600,"convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that",Notes from the Underground
600,"they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the",Notes from the Underground
600,"officer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"would certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the",Notes from the Underground
600,"billiard-table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the",Notes from the Underground
600,window.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that. I often",Notes from the Underground
600,met that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very,Notes from the Underground
600,"carefully. I am not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine not;",Notes from the Underground
600,I judge from certain signs. But I—I stared at him with spite and hatred,Notes from the Underground
600,and so it went on ... for several years! My resentment grew even deeper,Notes from the Underground
600,with years. At first I began making stealthy inquiries about this,Notes from the Underground
600,"officer. It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no one. But one",Notes from the Underground
600,day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I was following,Notes from the Underground
600,"him at a distance, as though I were tied to him—and so I learnt his",Notes from the Underground
600,"surname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks",Notes from the Underground
600,"learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he",Notes from the Underground
600,"lived alone or with others, and so on—in fact, everything one could",Notes from the Underground
600,"learn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with",Notes from the Underground
600,"the pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer",Notes from the Underground
600,in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the,Notes from the Underground
600,"novel with relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at",Notes from the Underground
600,"first I so altered his surname that it could easily be recognised, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the",Notes from the Underground
600,_Otetchestvenniya Zapiski_. But at that time such attacks were not the,Notes from the Underground
600,fashion and my story was not printed. That was a great vexation to me.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment. At last I determined,Notes from the Underground
600,"to challenge my enemy to a duel. I composed a splendid, charming letter",Notes from the Underground
600,"to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather plainly at",Notes from the Underground
600,a duel in case of refusal. The letter was so composed that if the,Notes from the Underground
600,officer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the,Notes from the Underground
600,beautiful he would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have,Notes from the Underground
600,offered me his friendship. And how fine that would have been! How we,Notes from the Underground
600,should have got on together! “He could have shielded me with his higher,Notes from the Underground
600,"rank, while I could have improved his mind with my culture, and, well",Notes from the Underground
600,"... my ideas, and all sorts of things might have happened.” Only fancy,",Notes from the Underground
600,"this was two years after his insult to me, and my challenge would have",Notes from the Underground
600,"been a ridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my",Notes from the Underground
600,"letter in disguising and explaining away the anachronism. But, thank",Notes from the Underground
600,God (to this day I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not,Notes from the Underground
600,send the letter to him. Cold shivers run down my back when I think of,Notes from the Underground
600,what might have happened if I had sent it.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of",Notes from the Underground
600,genius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me. Sometimes on,Notes from the Underground
600,holidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four,Notes from the Underground
600,o’clock in the afternoon. Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a,Notes from the Underground
600,"series of innumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no",Notes from the Underground
600,doubt that was just what I wanted. I used to wriggle along in a most,Notes from the Underground
600,"unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for",Notes from the Underground
600,"generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At",Notes from the Underground
600,"such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I",Notes from the Underground
600,used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the,Notes from the Underground
600,"wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my",Notes from the Underground
600,"little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual,",Notes from the Underground
600,"intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant",Notes from the Underground
600,"and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this",Notes from the Underground
600,"world, a nasty, disgusting fly—more intelligent, more highly developed,",Notes from the Underground
600,"more refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but a fly that was",Notes from the Underground
600,"continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I",Notes from the Underground
600,don’t know. I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I,Notes from the Underground
600,spoke in the first chapter. After my affair with the officer I felt,Notes from the Underground
600,even more drawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him,Notes from the Underground
600,"most frequently, there I could admire him. He, too, went there chiefly",Notes from the Underground
600,"on holidays, He, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons",Notes from the Underground
600,"of high rank, and he too, wriggled between them like an eel; but",Notes from the Underground
600,"people, like me, or even better dressed than me, he simply walked over;",Notes from the Underground
600,he made straight for them as though there was nothing but empty space,Notes from the Underground
600,"before him, and never, under any circumstances, turned aside. I gloated",Notes from the Underground
600,over my resentment watching him and ... always resentfully made way for,Notes from the Underground
600,him. It exasperated me that even in the street I could not be on an,Notes from the Underground
600,even footing with him.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking,Notes from the Underground
600,"myself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the",Notes from the Underground
600,morning. “Why is it you and not he? There’s no regulation about it;,Notes from the Underground
600,there’s no written law. Let the making way be equal as it usually is,Notes from the Underground
600,when refined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you,Notes from the Underground
600,pass with mutual respect.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not",Notes from the Underground
600,even notice my making way for him. And lo and behold a bright idea,Notes from the Underground
600,"dawned upon me! “What,” I thought, “if I meet him and don’t move on one",Notes from the Underground
600,"side? What if I don’t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up against",Notes from the Underground
600,him? How would that be?” This audacious idea took such a hold on me,Notes from the Underground
600,"that it gave me no peace. I was dreaming of it continually, horribly,",Notes from the Underground
600,and I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture,Notes from the Underground
600,more vividly how I should do it when I did do it. I was delighted. This,Notes from the Underground
600,intention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Of course I shall not really push him,” I thought, already more",Notes from the Underground
600,"good-natured in my joy. “I will simply not turn aside, will run up",Notes from the Underground
600,"against him, not very violently, but just shouldering each other—just",Notes from the Underground
600,as much as decency permits. I will push against him just as much as he,Notes from the Underground
600,pushes against me.” At last I made up my mind completely. But my,Notes from the Underground
600,"preparations took a great deal of time. To begin with, when I carried",Notes from the Underground
600,"out my plan I should need to be looking rather more decent, and so I",Notes from the Underground
600,"had to think of my get-up. “In case of emergency, if, for instance,",Notes from the Underground
600,there were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the,Notes from the Underground
600,most _recherché:_ the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all,Notes from the Underground
600,"the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires",Notes from the Underground
600,respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the,Notes from the Underground
600,society.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought",Notes from the Underground
600,at Tchurkin’s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat. Black gloves,Notes from the Underground
600,seemed to me both more dignified and _bon ton_ than the lemon-coloured,Notes from the Underground
600,"ones which I had contemplated at first. “The colour is too gaudy, it",Notes from the Underground
600,"looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take",Notes from the Underground
600,"the lemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt,",Notes from the Underground
600,with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me,Notes from the Underground
600,"back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it",Notes from the Underground
600,was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of,Notes from the Underground
600,"vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a",Notes from the Underground
600,beaver one like an officer’s. For this purpose I began visiting the,Notes from the Underground
600,Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap,Notes from the Underground
600,German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look,Notes from the Underground
600,"wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it",Notes from the Underground
600,"for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive.",Notes from the Underground
600,After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar.,Notes from the Underground
600,"The rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow",Notes from the Underground
600,"from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming",Notes from the Underground
600,"person, though grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an",Notes from the Underground
600,important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To,Notes from the Underground
600,borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did,Notes from the Underground
600,"not sleep for two or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that",Notes from the Underground
600,"time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a",Notes from the Underground
600,"sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised",Notes from the Underground
600,"at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me",Notes from the Underground

600,salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground

600,"the mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work. It",Notes from the Underground
600,"would never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be",Notes from the Underground
600,"carried out skilfully, by degrees. But I must confess that after many",Notes from the Underground
600,efforts I began to despair: we simply could not run into each other. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"made every preparation, I was quite determined—it seemed as though we",Notes from the Underground
600,should run into one another directly—and before I knew what I was doing,Notes from the Underground
600,I had stepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing,Notes from the Underground
600,me. I even prayed as I approached him that God would grant me,Notes from the Underground
600,"determination. One time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended",Notes from the Underground
600,in my stumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last,Notes from the Underground
600,instant when I was six inches from him my courage failed me. He very,Notes from the Underground
600,"calmly stepped over me, while I flew on one side like a ball. That",Notes from the Underground
600,"night I was ill again, feverish and delirious.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,And suddenly it ended most happily. The night before I had made up my,Notes from the Underground
600,"mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with",Notes from the Underground
600,"that object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I",Notes from the Underground
600,"would abandon it all. Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"unexpectedly made up my mind—I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt,",Notes from the Underground
600,"shoulder to shoulder, against one another! I did not budge an inch and",Notes from the Underground
600,passed him on a perfectly equal footing! He did not even look round and,Notes from the Underground
600,"pretended not to notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced",Notes from the Underground
600,"of that. I am convinced of that to this day! Of course, I got the worst",Notes from the Underground
600,"of it—he was stronger, but that was not the point. The point was that I",Notes from the Underground
600,"had attained my object, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a",Notes from the Underground
600,"step, and had put myself publicly on an equal social footing with him.",Notes from the Underground
600,I returned home feeling that I was fully avenged for everything. I was,Notes from the Underground
600,"delighted. I was triumphant and sang Italian arias. Of course, I will",Notes from the Underground
600,not describe to you what happened to me three days later; if you have,Notes from the Underground
600,read my first chapter you can guess for yourself. The officer was,Notes from the Underground
600,afterwards transferred; I have not seen him now for fourteen years.,Notes from the Underground

600,II,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick,Notes from the Underground
600,afterwards. It was followed by remorse—I tried to drive it away; I felt,Notes from the Underground
600,"too sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to",Notes from the Underground
600,"everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But",Notes from the Underground
600,I had a means of escape that reconciled everything—that was to find,Notes from the Underground
600,"refuge in “the sublime and the beautiful,” in dreams, of course. I was",Notes from the Underground
600,"a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away",Notes from the Underground
600,"in my corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no",Notes from the Underground
600,"resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken",Notes from the Underground
600,"heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat. I suddenly",Notes from the Underground
600,became a hero. I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if,Notes from the Underground
600,he had called on me. I could not even picture him before me then. What,Notes from the Underground
600,were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them—it is hard to,Notes from the Underground
600,"say now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed,",Notes from the Underground
600,"even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were",Notes from the Underground
600,particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came,Notes from the Underground
600,"with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were",Notes from the Underground
600,"moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there",Notes from the Underground
600,"was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had",Notes from the Underground
600,"faith, hope, love. I believed blindly at such times that by some",Notes from the Underground
600,"miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open",Notes from the Underground
600,"out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity—beneficent,",Notes from the Underground
600,"good, and, above all, _ready made_ (what sort of activity I had no",Notes from the Underground
600,"idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready for me)—would",Notes from the Underground
600,"rise up before me—and I should come out into the light of day, almost",Notes from the Underground
600,riding a white horse and crowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost,Notes from the Underground
600,"place I could not conceive for myself, and for that very reason I quite",Notes from the Underground
600,contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. Either to be a hero or to,Notes from the Underground
600,"grovel in the mud—there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when",Notes from the Underground
600,I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other,Notes from the Underground
600,"times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an",Notes from the Underground
600,"ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too",Notes from the Underground
600,"lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is",Notes from the Underground
600,worth noting that these attacks of the “sublime and the beautiful”,Notes from the Underground
600,visited me even during the period of dissipation and just at the times,Notes from the Underground
600,"when I was touching the bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though",Notes from the Underground
600,"reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their",Notes from the Underground
600,"appearance. On the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by",Notes from the Underground
600,"contrast, and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetising",Notes from the Underground
600,"sauce. That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"agonising inward analysis, and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a",Notes from the Underground
600,"certain piquancy, even a significance to my dissipation—in fact,",Notes from the Underground
600,completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce. There was a,Notes from the Underground
600,certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned myself,Notes from the Underground
600,"to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured",Notes from the Underground
600,all the filthiness of it. What could have allured me about it then and,Notes from the Underground
600,"have drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a lofty way of",Notes from the Underground
600,getting out of it all.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times",Notes from the Underground
600,in those dreams of mine! in those “flights into the sublime and the,Notes from the Underground
600,"beautiful”; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied",Notes from the Underground
600,"to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that",Notes from the Underground
600,one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality;,Notes from the Underground
600,"that would have been superfluous. Everything, however, passed",Notes from the Underground
600,satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of,Notes from the Underground
600,"art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely",Notes from the Underground
600,stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs,Notes from the Underground
600,"and uses. I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to",Notes from the Underground
600,"recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a",Notes from the Underground
600,"grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and",Notes from the Underground
600,"immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed",Notes from the Underground
600,"before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not",Notes from the Underground
600,"merely shameful, but had in them much that was “sublime and beautiful”",Notes from the Underground
600,something in the Manfred style. Everyone would kiss me and weep (what,Notes from the Underground
600,"idiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and",Notes from the Underground
600,hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against,Notes from the Underground
600,"the obscurantists. Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would",Notes from the Underground
600,"be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then",Notes from the Underground
600,there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on,Notes from the Underground
600,"the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred",Notes from the Underground
600,"to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and so on, and so on—as though you did not know all about it? You will",Notes from the Underground
600,say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag all this into public,Notes from the Underground
600,after all the tears and transports which I have myself confessed. But,Notes from the Underground
600,"why is it contemptible? Can you imagine that I am ashamed of it all,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? And I",Notes from the Underground
600,can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly,Notes from the Underground
600,composed.... It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet,Notes from the Underground
600,you are right—it really is vulgar and contemptible. And most,Notes from the Underground
600,contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to,Notes from the Underground
600,you. And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark now.,Notes from the Underground
600,"But that’s enough, or there will be no end to it; each step will be",Notes from the Underground
600,more contemptible than the last....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time,Notes from the Underground
600,without feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society. To,Notes from the Underground
600,"plunge into society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton",Notes from the Underground
600,Antonitch Syetotchkin. He was the only permanent acquaintance I have,Notes from the Underground
600,"had in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now. But I only went to",Notes from the Underground
600,"see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached",Notes from the Underground
600,such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my,Notes from the Underground
600,"fellows and all mankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one",Notes from the Underground
600,"human being, actually existing. I had to call on Anton Antonitch,",Notes from the Underground
600,"however, on Tuesday—his at-home day; so I had always to time my",Notes from the Underground
600,passionate desire to embrace humanity so that it might fall on a,Notes from the Underground
600,Tuesday.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five,Notes from the Underground
600,"Corners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a",Notes from the Underground
600,particularly frugal and sallow appearance. He had two daughters and,Notes from the Underground
600,"their aunt, who used to pour out the tea. Of the daughters one was",Notes from the Underground
600,"thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was",Notes from the Underground
600,awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling,Notes from the Underground
600,together. The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather,Notes from the Underground
600,"couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a",Notes from the Underground
600,colleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more,Notes from the Underground
600,"than two or three visitors there, always the same. They talked about",Notes from the Underground
600,"the excise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about",Notes from the Underground
600,"promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him,",Notes from the Underground
600,and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people,Notes from the Underground
600,"for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to",Notes from the Underground
600,"say to them or venturing to say a word. I became stupefied, several",Notes from the Underground
600,"times I felt myself perspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis;",Notes from the Underground
600,but this was pleasant and good for me. On returning home I deferred for,Notes from the Underground
600,a time my desire to embrace all mankind.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an old",Notes from the Underground
600,"schoolfellow. I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg,",Notes from the Underground
600,but I did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them,Notes from the Underground
600,in the street. I believe I had transferred into the department I was in,Notes from the Underground
600,simply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my,Notes from the Underground
600,hateful childhood. Curses on that school and all those terrible years,Notes from the Underground
600,"of penal servitude! In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as",Notes from the Underground
600,I got out into the world. There were two or three left to whom I nodded,Notes from the Underground
600,"in the street. One of them was Simonov, who had in no way been",Notes from the Underground
600,"distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I",Notes from the Underground
600,discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty,Notes from the Underground
600,I don’t even suppose that he was particularly stupid. I had at one time,Notes from the Underground
600,"spent some rather soulful moments with him, but these had not lasted",Notes from the Underground
600,long and had somehow been suddenly clouded over. He was evidently,Notes from the Underground
600,"uncomfortable at these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid",Notes from the Underground
600,that I might take up the same tone again. I suspected that he had an,Notes from the Underground
600,"aversion for me, but still I went on going to see him, not being quite",Notes from the Underground
600,certain of it.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing that",Notes from the Underground
600,"as it was Thursday Anton Antonitch’s door would be closed, I thought of",Notes from the Underground
600,Simonov. Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that the man,Notes from the Underground
600,disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him. But as it,Notes from the Underground
600,"always happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,",Notes from the Underground
600,"to put myself into a false position, I went in. It was almost a year",Notes from the Underground

600,III,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I found two of my old schoolfellows with him. They seemed to be,Notes from the Underground
600,discussing an important matter. All of them took scarcely any notice of,Notes from the Underground
600,"my entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years.",Notes from the Underground
600,Evidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common,Notes from the Underground
600,"fly. I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all",Notes from the Underground
600,"hated me. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack",Notes from the Underground
600,"of success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low,",Notes from the Underground
600,going about badly dressed and so on—which seemed to them a sign of my,Notes from the Underground
600,incapacity and insignificance. But I had not expected such contempt.,Notes from the Underground
600,Simonov was positively surprised at my turning up. Even in old days he,Notes from the Underground
600,had always seemed surprised at my coming. All this disconcerted me: I,Notes from the Underground
600,"sat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they",Notes from the Underground
600,were saying.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell,Notes from the Underground
600,dinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of,Notes from the Underground
600,"theirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a",Notes from the Underground
600,distant province. This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me,Notes from the Underground
600,too. I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms. In the,Notes from the Underground
600,"lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody",Notes from the Underground
600,"liked. I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because",Notes from the Underground
600,he was a pretty and playful boy. He was always bad at his lessons and,Notes from the Underground
600,"got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good",Notes from the Underground
600,"certificate, as he had powerful interests. During his last year at",Notes from the Underground
600,"school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all",Notes from the Underground
600,of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us. He was vulgar in,Notes from the Underground
600,"the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in",Notes from the Underground
600,"his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of",Notes from the Underground
600,"honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before",Notes from the Underground
600,"Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from any",Notes from the Underground
600,"interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been",Notes from the Underground
600,"favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an",Notes from the Underground
600,accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact,Notes from the Underground
600,and the social graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of",Notes from the Underground
600,"his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was",Notes from the Underground
600,"bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which",Notes from the Underground
600,"I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the",Notes from the Underground
600,free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.” I hated,Notes from the Underground
600,the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he,Notes from the Underground
600,did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the,Notes from the Underground
600,"epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with",Notes from the Underground
600,"impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.",Notes from the Underground
600,"I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon",Notes from the Underground
600,"Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his",Notes from the Underground
600,"schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as",Notes from the Underground
600,"sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would",Notes from the Underground
600,"not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was",Notes from the Underground
600,"his _droit de seigneur_, and that if the peasants dared to protest he",Notes from the Underground
600,"would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded",Notes from the Underground
600,"rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from",Notes from the Underground
600,"compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they",Notes from the Underground
600,were applauding such an insect. I got the better of him on that,Notes from the Underground
600,"occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really",Notes from the Underground
600,complete; the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several,Notes from the Underground
600,"occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually. I",Notes from the Underground
600,remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him.,Notes from the Underground
600,"When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for",Notes from the Underground
600,"I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I",Notes from the Underground
600,"heard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life",Notes from the Underground
600,he was leading. Then there came other rumours—of his successes in the,Notes from the Underground
600,"service. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I",Notes from the Underground
600,suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a,Notes from the Underground
600,"personage as insignificant as me. I saw him once in the theatre, in the",Notes from the Underground
600,third tier of boxes. By then he was wearing shoulder-straps. He was,Notes from the Underground
600,"twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of",Notes from the Underground
600,"an ancient General. In three years he had gone off considerably, though",Notes from the Underground
600,he was still rather handsome and adroit. One could see that by the time,Notes from the Underground
600,he was thirty he would be corpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my,Notes from the Underground
600,schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure. They had,Notes from the Underground
600,"kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not",Notes from the Underground
600,"consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of",Notes from the Underground
600,that.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German—a",Notes from the Underground
600,"little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always",Notes from the Underground
600,"deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the",Notes from the Underground
600,"lower forms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most",Notes from the Underground
600,"sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a",Notes from the Underground
600,wretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of,Notes from the Underground
600,"Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often",Notes from the Underground
600,"borrowed money from him. Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a",Notes from the Underground
600,"person in no way remarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a",Notes from the Underground
600,"cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,",Notes from the Underground
600,and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of,Notes from the Underground
600,"distant relation of Zverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him",Notes from the Underground
600,a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“My goodness, why didn’t you say so?” I cried, seizing my cap, with an",Notes from the Underground

600,expected of myself.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“It’s close by ... not two paces away,” Simonov repeated, accompanying",Notes from the Underground
600,me to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all.,Notes from the Underground
600,"“So five o’clock, punctually, tomorrow,” he called down the stairs",Notes from the Underground

600,"wondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, “for a",Notes from the Underground

600,I’ll send Simonov a note by tomorrow’s post....”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,",Notes from the Underground

600,"unseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money. All I,Notes from the Underground
600,"had was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant,",Notes from the Underground
600,"Apollon, for his monthly wages. That was all I paid him—he had to keep",Notes from the Underground
600,himself.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character. But I will",Notes from the Underground
600,"talk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,That night I had the most hideous dreams. No wonder; all the evening I,Notes from the Underground
600,"had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I",Notes from the Underground
600,could not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant,Notes from the Underground
600,"relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing",Notes from the Underground
600,"since—they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by",Notes from the Underground
600,"their reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage",Notes from the Underground
600,distrust at everyone. My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and,Notes from the Underground
600,merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But I could not,Notes from the Underground
600,endure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble,Notes from the Underground
600,readiness with which they gave in to one another. I hated them from the,Notes from the Underground
600,"first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and",Notes from the Underground
600,disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed,Notes from the Underground
600,"cynically at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces",Notes from the Underground
600,they had themselves. In our school the boys’ faces seemed in a special,Notes from the Underground
600,way to degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-looking boys came to,Notes from the Underground
600,us! In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at,Notes from the Underground
600,them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their,Notes from the Underground
600,"thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their",Notes from the Underground
600,"conversations. They had no understanding of such essential things, they",Notes from the Underground
600,"took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could",Notes from the Underground
600,not help considering them inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity,Notes from the Underground
600,"that drove me to it, and for God’s sake do not thrust upon me your",Notes from the Underground
600,"hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that “I was only a dreamer,”",Notes from the Underground
600,while they even then had an understanding of life. They understood,Notes from the Underground
600,"nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what",Notes from the Underground
600,"made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the most obvious,",Notes from the Underground
600,striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at,Notes from the Underground
600,"that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was just,",Notes from the Underground
600,"but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and",Notes from the Underground
600,shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were,Notes from the Underground
600,"already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great deal of it was",Notes from the Underground
600,"due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always",Notes from the Underground
600,been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously,Notes from the Underground
600,"depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an",Notes from the Underground
600,assumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and,Notes from the Underground
600,freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not,Notes from the Underground
600,"attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated them",Notes from the Underground
600,"horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any of them. They repaid me",Notes from the Underground
600,"in the same way, and did not conceal their aversion for me. But by then",Notes from the Underground
600,"I did not desire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed",Notes from the Underground
600,for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely began,Notes from the Underground
600,to make all the progress I could with my studies and forced my way to,Notes from the Underground
600,"the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by degrees",Notes from the Underground
600,"to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read, and",Notes from the Underground
600,understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which,Notes from the Underground
600,"they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it,",Notes from the Underground
600,"but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice",Notes from the Underground
600,"me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained,",Notes from the Underground
600,and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end,Notes from the Underground
600,"I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for",Notes from the Underground
600,"friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with",Notes from the Underground
600,some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them,Notes from the Underground
600,"was always strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have",Notes from the Underground
600,a friend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise,Notes from the Underground
600,unbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into him a contempt for his,Notes from the Underground
600,surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and complete break with,Notes from the Underground
600,those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I,Notes from the Underground
600,"reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul;",Notes from the Underground
600,but when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him,Notes from the Underground
600,immediately and repulsed him—as though all I needed him for was to win,Notes from the Underground
600,"a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not",Notes from the Underground
600,"subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he",Notes from the Underground
600,"was, in fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school",Notes from the Underground
600,was to give up the special job for which I had been destined so as to,Notes from the Underground
600,"break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my",Notes from the Underground
600,"feet.... And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging",Notes from the Underground
600,off to Simonov’s!,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with,Notes from the Underground
600,"excitement, as though it were all about to happen at once. But I",Notes from the Underground
600,"believed that some radical change in my life was coming, and would",Notes from the Underground
600,"inevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external",Notes from the Underground
600,"event, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical",Notes from the Underground
600,"change in my life were at hand. I went to the office, however, as",Notes from the Underground
600,"usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The great",Notes from the Underground
600,"thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think",Notes from the Underground
600,I am overjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such great points,Notes from the Underground
600,"to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I polished my",Notes from the Underground
600,boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have,Notes from the Underground
600,"induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was",Notes from the Underground
600,more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them,Notes from the Underground
600,"from the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of",Notes from the Underground
600,his contempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that,Notes from the Underground
600,"everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too",Notes from the Underground
600,"slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to",Notes from the Underground
600,dinner in my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my,Notes from the Underground
600,trousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain,Notes from the Underground
600,"would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too,",Notes from the Underground
600,that it was very poor to think so. “But this is no time for thinking:,Notes from the Underground
600,"now I am in for the real thing,” I thought, and my heart sank. I knew,",Notes from the Underground
600,"too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating the",Notes from the Underground
600,facts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was,Notes from the Underground
600,already shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how,Notes from the Underground
600,coldly and disdainfully that “scoundrel” Zverkov would meet me; with,Notes from the Underground
600,"what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would",Notes from the Underground
600,look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would,Notes from the Underground
600,snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely,Notes from the Underground
600,"Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the",Notes from the Underground
600,"abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit—and, worst of all, how",Notes from the Underground
600,"paltry, _unliterary_, commonplace it would all be. Of course, the best",Notes from the Underground
600,thing would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all:,Notes from the Underground
600,"if I feel impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I",Notes from the Underground
600,"should have jeered at myself ever afterwards: “So you funked it, you",Notes from the Underground
600,"funked it, you funked the _real thing!_” On the contrary, I",Notes from the Underground
600,passionately longed to show all that “rabble” that I was by no means,Notes from the Underground
600,"such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in",Notes from the Underground
600,"the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the",Notes from the Underground
600,"upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them like",Notes from the Underground
600,me—if only for my “elevation of thought and unmistakable wit.” They,Notes from the Underground
600,"would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed,",Notes from the Underground
600,"while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be reconciled and",Notes from the Underground
600,drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter and,Notes from the Underground
600,"humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for",Notes from the Underground
600,"certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not",Notes from the Underground
600,"really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not",Notes from the Underground
600,"care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I",Notes from the Underground
600,prayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to,Notes from the Underground
600,"the window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled",Notes from the Underground
600,darkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At last my wretched little,Notes from the Underground
600,"clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at",Notes from the Underground
600,"Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month’s wages, but in his",Notes from the Underground
600,"foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped",Notes from the Underground
600,"between him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on",Notes from the Underground
600,"which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the",Notes from the Underground
600,Hôtel de Paris.,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.,Notes from the Underground
600,But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were,Notes from the Underground
600,"they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was",Notes from the Underground
600,not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited,Notes from the Underground
600,"from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for",Notes from the Underground
600,six o’clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really,Notes from the Underground
600,ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past,Notes from the Underground
600,five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let,Notes from the Underground
600,"me know—that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an",Notes from the Underground
600,absurd position in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I,Notes from the Underground
600,sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even more,Notes from the Underground
600,humiliated when he was present. Towards six o’clock they brought in,Notes from the Underground
600,"candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not",Notes from the Underground
600,"occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I",Notes from the Underground
600,"arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating",Notes from the Underground
600,their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great,Notes from the Underground
600,"deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear",Notes from the Underground
600,"the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French:",Notes from the Underground
600,"there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely",Notes from the Underground
600,"passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive",Notes from the Underground
600,"all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though",Notes from the Underground
600,"they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me",Notes from the Underground
600,to show resentment.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading,Notes from the Underground
600,"spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew",Notes from the Underground
600,"himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather",Notes from the Underground
600,"jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like",Notes from the Underground
600,"that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off",Notes from the Underground
600,"something. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would",Notes from the Underground
600,"at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making",Notes from the Underground
600,his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever,Notes from the Underground
600,"since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such",Notes from the Underground
600,"high-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to",Notes from the Underground
600,me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that,Notes from the Underground
600,"high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought—I could pay him back",Notes from the Underground
600,"for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, without the least",Notes from the Underground
600,"desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he",Notes from the Underground
600,was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way? The,Notes from the Underground
600,very supposition made me gasp.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,” he began, lisping",Notes from the Underground
600,"and drawling, which was something new. “You and I seem to have seen",Notes from the Underground
600,nothing of one another. You fight shy of us. You shouldn’t. We are not,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“No, I didn’t. I forgot,” the latter replied, with no sign of regret,",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“So you’ve been here a whole hour? Oh, poor fellow!” Zverkov cried",Notes from the Underground

600,and embarrassing.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“It isn’t funny at all!” I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“It’s not only absurd, but something else as well,” muttered",Notes from the Underground

600,"see, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?” he",Notes from the Underground
600,"suddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me.",Notes from the Underground
600,Evidently he had something against me. It must have been what happened,Notes from the Underground
600,yesterday.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,All sat down; I did the same. It was a round table. Trudolyubov was on,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Tell me, are you ... in a government office?” Zverkov went on",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?” I thought, in a fury.",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had,Notes from the Underground
600,almost been married two days before. There was not a word about the,Notes from the Underground
600,"marriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels",Notes from the Underground
600,"and kammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them. It",Notes from the Underground
600,was greeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.,Notes from the Underground

600,"yes, sing, for I have the right to ... to sing ... H’m!”",Notes from the Underground

600,"wished, how I wished at that moment to be reconciled to them! It struck",Notes from the Underground
600,"eight, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa. Zverkov",Notes from the Underground
600,stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round table. Wine,Notes from the Underground
600,"was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own",Notes from the Underground
600,"account. I, of course, was not invited to join them. They all sat round",Notes from the Underground
600,"him on the sofa. They listened to him, almost with reverence. It was",Notes from the Underground
600,evident that they were fond of him. “What for? What for?” I wondered.,Notes from the Underground
600,From time to time they were moved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each,Notes from the Underground
600,"other. They talked of the Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"snug berths in the service, of the income of an hussar called",Notes from the Underground
600,"Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the",Notes from the Underground

600,being immortal.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the,Notes from the Underground
600,"room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again. I",Notes from the Underground
600,"tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet",Notes from the Underground
600,"I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it",Notes from the Underground
600,was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up,Notes from the Underground
600,"and down in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same",Notes from the Underground
600,"place, from the table to the stove and back again. “I walk up and down",Notes from the Underground
600,to please myself and no one can prevent me.” The waiter who came into,Notes from the Underground
600,"the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat",Notes from the Underground
600,giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I,Notes from the Underground
600,was in delirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with,Notes from the Underground
600,"sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was",Notes from the Underground
600,"stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty",Notes from the Underground
600,"years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with",Notes from the Underground
600,"loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most",Notes from the Underground
600,awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to,Notes from the Underground
600,"degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. “Oh, if",Notes from the Underground
600,"you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured",Notes from the Underground
600,"I am!” I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my",Notes from the Underground
600,enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as though I were not in,Notes from the Underground
600,"the room. Once—only once—they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was",Notes from the Underground
600,"talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh. I",Notes from the Underground
600,laughed in such an affected and disgusting way that they all at once,Notes from the Underground
600,"broke off their conversation, and silently and gravely for two minutes",Notes from the Underground
600,"watched me walking up and down from the table to the stove, _taking no",Notes from the Underground
600,"notice of them_. But nothing came of it: they said nothing, and two",Notes from the Underground
600,minutes later they ceased to notice me again. It struck eleven.,Notes from the Underground

600,"I stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow",Notes from the Underground
600,"in the middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"What was I to do? I could not go on there—it was evidently stupid, and",Notes from the Underground

600,"“What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?” the peasant shouted,",Notes from the Underground

600,"The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless",Notes from the Underground
600,"of it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and felt with horror that it was going to happen _now, at once_, and",Notes from the Underground
600,that _no force could stop it_. The deserted street lamps gleamed,Notes from the Underground
600,sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow,Notes from the Underground
600,"drifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted",Notes from the Underground
600,"there. I did not wrap myself up—all was lost, anyway.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps",Notes from the Underground
600,"and began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak,",Notes from the Underground
600,particularly in my legs and knees. The door was opened quickly as,Notes from the Underground
600,"though they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that",Notes from the Underground
600,"perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which",Notes from the Underground
600,one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one,Notes from the Underground
600,of those “millinery establishments” which were abolished by the police,Notes from the Underground
600,"a good time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had",Notes from the Underground
600,"an introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-room,",Notes from the Underground
600,"where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement:",Notes from the Underground
600,"there was no one there. “Where are they?” I asked somebody. But by now,",Notes from the Underground
600,"of course, they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a",Notes from the Underground
600,"stupid smile, the “madam” herself, who had seen me before. A minute",Notes from the Underground
600,later a door opened and another person came in.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I",Notes from the Underground
600,talked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was,Notes from the Underground
600,"conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here",Notes from the Underground
600,and ... everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could,Notes from the Underground
600,not realise my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had,Notes from the Underground
600,"come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with",Notes from the Underground
600,"straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes",Notes from the Underground
600,that attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been,Notes from the Underground
600,"smiling. I began looking at her more intently and, as it were, with",Notes from the Underground
600,effort. I had not fully collected my thoughts. There was something,Notes from the Underground
600,"simple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I",Notes from the Underground
600,"am sure that this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had",Notes from the Underground
600,"noticed her. She could not, however, have been called a beauty, though",Notes from the Underground
600,"she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very simply",Notes from the Underground
600,dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to,Notes from the Underground
600,her.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as,Notes from the Underground
600,"revolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair.",Notes from the Underground
600,"“No matter, I am glad of it,” I thought; “I am glad that I shall seem",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"... Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though",Notes from the Underground
600,"oppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an",Notes from the Underground
600,"unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as",Notes from the Underground
600,"it were unexpectedly rapid, chime—as though someone were suddenly",Notes from the Underground
600,"jumping forward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been",Notes from the Underground
600,asleep but lying half-conscious.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room,",Notes from the Underground
600,cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and,Notes from the Underground
600,all sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning,Notes from the Underground
600,on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time.,Notes from the Underground
600,In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at,Notes from the Underground
600,"once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon",Notes from the Underground
600,"me again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed",Notes from the Underground
600,"continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams",Notes from the Underground
600,"moved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me",Notes from the Underground
600,"in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away",Notes from the Underground
600,"past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me,",Notes from the Underground
600,"rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite",Notes from the Underground
600,seemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw,Notes from the Underground
600,beside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and,Notes from the Underground
600,"persistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it",Notes from the Underground
600,were utterly remote; it weighed upon me.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a",Notes from the Underground
600,"horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and",Notes from the Underground
600,"mouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in those two eyes,",Notes from the Underground
600,"beginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those",Notes from the Underground
600,"two hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in",Notes from the Underground
600,"fact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for",Notes from the Underground
600,some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous,Notes from the Underground
600,"idea—revolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and",Notes from the Underground
600,shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation.,Notes from the Underground
600,"For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop",Notes from the Underground
600,"her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last",Notes from the Underground
600,I felt uncomfortable.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“What is your name?” I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Liza,” she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from",Notes from the Underground
600,"graciously, and she turned her eyes away.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I was silent.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“What weather! The snow ... it’s disgusting!” I said, almost to myself,",Notes from the Underground
600,"putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,She made no answer. This was horrible.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,We were silent.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and,Notes from the Underground
600,"dreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from",Notes from the Underground
600,"my will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled",Notes from the Underground
600,"something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was",Notes from the Underground
600,hurrying to the office.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began,Notes from the Underground
600,to feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was,Notes from the Underground
600,already longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my,Notes from the Underground

600,before me.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps,",Notes from the Underground
600,"worse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though,” I hastened,",Notes from the Underground
600,"however, to say in self-defence. “Besides, a man is no example for a",Notes from the Underground
600,"woman. It’s a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I",Notes from the Underground
600,"am not anyone’s slave. I come and go, and that’s an end of it. I shake",Notes from the Underground
600,"it off, and I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Yes, a slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want",Notes from the Underground
600,"to break your chains afterwards, you won’t be able to; you will be more",Notes from the Underground

600,"afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you.",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“Yes!” she assented sharply and hurriedly.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this “Yes.” So the,Notes from the Underground
600,same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was,Notes from the Underground
600,"staring at me just before. So she, too, was capable of certain",Notes from the Underground
600,"thoughts? “Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of",Notes from the Underground
600,"likeness!” I thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it’s easy to",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.,Notes from the Underground

600,How I regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep,Notes from the Underground
600,breathing.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Why have you come here?” I asked her, with a note of authority already",Notes from the Underground
600,in my voice.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Oh, I don’t know.”",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“But how nice it would be to be living in your father’s house! It’s,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“But what if it’s worse than this?”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“I must take the right tone,” flashed through my mind. “I may not get",Notes from the Underground
600,far with sentimentality.” But it was only a momentary thought. I swear,Notes from the Underground

600,cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“Who denies it!” I hastened to answer. “Anything may happen. I am,Notes from the Underground
600,"convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned",Notes from the Underground
600,"against than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it’s",Notes from the Underground

600,"“See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from",Notes from the Underground

600,"bad it may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not",Notes from the Underground
600,"enemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they’ll show their love of",Notes from the Underground

600,"used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands,",Notes from the Underground
600,"her feet, he couldn’t make enough of her, really. When she danced at",Notes from the Underground
600,"parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He",Notes from the Underground
600,was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at,Notes from the Underground
600,"night, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of",Notes from the Underground
600,"the cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was",Notes from the Underground
600,"stingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving",Notes from the Underground
600,"her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was",Notes from the Underground
600,pleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more,Notes from the Underground
600,than the mothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I,Notes from the Underground
600,should never let my daughters marry.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“What next?” she said, with a faint smile.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss",Notes from the Underground

600,father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let,Notes from the Underground
600,"her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all",Notes from the Underground
600,her suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself,Notes from the Underground

600,"“H’m ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up",Notes from the Underground
600,"his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he",Notes from the Underground
600,"ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for",Notes from the Underground
600,"it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God",Notes from the Underground
600,"is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you,",Notes from the Underground
600,never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes,Notes from the Underground
600,there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is,Notes from the Underground
600,everywhere. If you marry _you will find out for yourself_. But think of,Notes from the Underground
600,"the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what",Notes from the Underground
600,happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it’s the ordinary thing.,Notes from the Underground
600,In those early days even quarrels with one’s husband end happily. Some,Notes from the Underground
600,women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them.,Notes from the Underground
600,"Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she",Notes from the Underground
600,"loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that",Notes from the Underground
600,you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly,Notes from the Underground
600,"given to that, thinking to themselves ‘I will love him so, I will make",Notes from the Underground
600,"so much of him afterwards, that it’s no sin to torment him a little",Notes from the Underground
600,"now.’ And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are",Notes from the Underground
600,happy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women,Notes from the Underground
600,"who are jealous. If he went off anywhere—I knew one such woman, she",Notes from the Underground
600,"couldn’t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on",Notes from the Underground
600,"the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman.",Notes from the Underground
600,"That’s a pity. And the woman knows herself it’s wrong, and her heart",Notes from the Underground
600,"fails her and she suffers, but she loves—it’s all through love. And how",Notes from the Underground
600,"sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or",Notes from the Underground
600,to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once—as though they,Notes from the Underground
600,"had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun",Notes from the Underground
600,"afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and",Notes from the Underground
600,wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be,Notes from the Underground
600,between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge,Notes from the Underground
600,between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges.,Notes from the Underground
600,"Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes,",Notes from the Underground
600,whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one,Notes from the Underground
600,"another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been",Notes from the Underground
600,"love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away?",Notes from the Underground
600,Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the,Notes from the Underground
600,"husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The",Notes from the Underground
600,"first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will",Notes from the Underground
600,come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of,Notes from the Underground
600,"souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets",Notes from the Underground
600,"between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times",Notes from the Underground
600,"will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even",Notes from the Underground
600,"toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and",Notes from the Underground
600,"even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you",Notes from the Underground
600,are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that,Notes from the Underground
600,"you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your",Notes from the Underground
600,"children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have",Notes from the Underground
600,"received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness.",Notes from the Underground
600,So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and,Notes from the Underground
600,mother nearer? People say it’s a trial to have children. Who says that?,Notes from the Underground
600,"It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am",Notes from the Underground
600,"awfully fond of them. You know—a little rosy baby boy at your bosom,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his",Notes from the Underground
600,"child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little",Notes from the Underground
600,"hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one",Notes from the Underground
600,laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything.,Notes from the Underground
600,"And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand,",Notes from the Underground
600,"plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the",Notes from the Underground
600,"bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it",Notes from the Underground
600,"were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its",Notes from the Underground
600,"mother’s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks",Notes from the Underground
600,"sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, ‘Look, I am",Notes from the Underground
600,"biting!’ Is not all that happiness when they are the three together,",Notes from the Underground
600,"husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of",Notes from the Underground
600,"such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before",Notes from the Underground

600,"unyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced",Notes from the Underground

600,a note of irony in her voice.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that",Notes from the Underground

600,their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and,Notes from the Underground
600,shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to,Notes from the Underground
600,have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly,Notes from the Underground
600,"approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with",Notes from the Underground
600,"an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of",Notes from the Underground

600,"let me tell you this about it—about your present life, I mean; here",Notes from the Underground
600,"though you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet",Notes from the Underground
600,you know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at,Notes from the Underground
600,being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if,Notes from the Underground
600,"you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be",Notes from the Underground
600,"more than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be",Notes from the Underground
600,"glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your",Notes from the Underground
600,"door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my",Notes from the Underground
600,betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to,Notes from the Underground
600,"have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have",Notes from the Underground
600,only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or,Notes from the Underground
600,"not. I don’t consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer",Notes from the Underground
600,"hires himself as a workman, but he doesn’t make a slave of himself",Notes from the Underground
600,"altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But",Notes from the Underground
600,when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it,Notes from the Underground
600,"you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with your body;",Notes from the Underground
600,you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of! You,Notes from the Underground
600,give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that’s,Notes from the Underground
600,"everything, you know, it’s a priceless diamond, it’s a maiden’s",Notes from the Underground
600,"treasure, love—why, a man would be ready to give his soul, to face",Notes from the Underground
600,death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are,Notes from the Underground
600,"sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for",Notes from the Underground
600,love when you can have everything without love. And you know there is,Notes from the Underground
600,"no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be sure, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers",Notes from the Underground
600,"of your own here. But you know that’s simply a farce, that’s simply a",Notes from the Underground
600,"sham, it’s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do",Notes from the Underground
600,"you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don’t believe",Notes from the Underground
600,it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him,Notes from the Underground
600,any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of,Notes from the Underground
600,respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and,Notes from the Underground
600,robs you—that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not,Notes from the Underground
600,"beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got",Notes from the Underground
600,"one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your face, if he",Notes from the Underground
600,doesn’t spit in it or give you a blow—though maybe he is not worth a,Notes from the Underground
600,"bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you",Notes from the Underground
600,come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to drink and the,Notes from the Underground
600,plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you up? An,Notes from the Underground
600,"honest girl couldn’t swallow the food, for she would know what she was",Notes from the Underground
600,"being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be",Notes from the Underground
600,"in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here",Notes from the Underground
600,"begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don’t rely upon your",Notes from the Underground
600,"youth—all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be",Notes from the Underground
600,kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she’ll begin,Notes from the Underground
600,"nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not",Notes from the Underground
600,"sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your",Notes from the Underground
600,"soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her,",Notes from the Underground
600,"robbed her. And don’t expect anyone to take your part: the others, your",Notes from the Underground
600,"companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in",Notes from the Underground
600,"slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They",Notes from the Underground
600,"have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more",Notes from the Underground
600,"loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down",Notes from the Underground
600,"everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No",Notes from the Underground
600,doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do!,Notes from the Underground
600,Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has,Notes from the Underground
600,been. One would think that the heart alone would be worn out with,Notes from the Underground
600,"tears. And you won’t dare to say a word, not half a word when they",Notes from the Underground
600,drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame.,Notes from the Underground
600,"You will change to another house, then to a third, then somewhere else,",Notes from the Underground
600,till you come down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten,Notes from the Underground
600,"at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don’t know how",Notes from the Underground
600,to be friendly without beating you. You don’t believe that it is so,Notes from the Underground
600,"hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with",Notes from the Underground
600,"your own eyes. Once, one New Year’s Day, I saw a woman at a door. They",Notes from the Underground
600,"had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost because",Notes from the Underground
600,"she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine",Notes from the Underground
600,"o’clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled,",Notes from the Underground
600,"half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but she had a",Notes from the Underground
600,"black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some cabman",Notes from the Underground
600,"had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a",Notes from the Underground
600,"salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing",Notes from the Underground
600,"something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and",Notes from the Underground
600,cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her.,Notes from the Underground
600,You don’t believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to,Notes from the Underground
600,"believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago",Notes from the Underground
600,"that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub,",Notes from the Underground
600,"innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she",Notes from the Underground
600,"was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others;",Notes from the Underground
600,"perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store",Notes from the Underground
600,for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see,Notes from the Underground
600,how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on,Notes from the Underground
600,"the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled—what if at",Notes from the Underground
600,that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father’s,Notes from the Underground
600,"house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour’s son watched",Notes from the Underground
600,"for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as long as he",Notes from the Underground
600,"lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to",Notes from the Underground
600,love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up!,Notes from the Underground
600,"No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of",Notes from the Underground
600,"consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. In",Notes from the Underground
600,"the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what",Notes from the Underground
600,if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer,Notes from the Underground
600,"disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the last",Notes from the Underground
600,minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself And that just suits,Notes from the Underground
600,"your madam. Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have sold your soul,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a word. But when you",Notes from the Underground
600,"are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then",Notes from the Underground
600,"there will be nothing to get from you. What’s more, they will reproach",Notes from the Underground
600,"you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you",Notes from the Underground
600,beg you won’t get a drink of water without abuse: ‘Whenever are you,Notes from the Underground
600,"going off, you nasty hussy, you won’t let us sleep with your moaning,",Notes from the Underground
600,"you make the gentlemen sick.’ That’s true, I have heard such things",Notes from the Underground
600,said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in,Notes from the Underground
600,"the cellar—in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying",Notes from the Underground
600,"there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with",Notes from the Underground
600,"grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for",Notes from the Underground
600,"you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy",Notes from the Underground
600,"a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet",Notes from the Underground
600,"snow—no need to put themselves out for you—‘Let her down, Vanuha; it’s",Notes from the Underground
600,"just like her luck—even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten",Notes from the Underground
600,"the cord, you rascal.’ ‘It’s all right as it is.’ ‘All right, is it?",Notes from the Underground
600,"Why, she’s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But,",Notes from the Underground
600,"never mind, throw the earth on her.’ And they won’t care to waste much",Notes from the Underground
600,time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick,Notes from the Underground
600,as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth,Notes from the Underground
600,"will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers,",Notes from the Underground
600,"husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one",Notes from the Underground
600,"in the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from",Notes from the Underground
600,"the face of the earth—as though you had never existed, never been born",Notes from the Underground
600,"at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid",Notes from the Underground
600,"at night, when the dead arise, however you cry: ‘Let me out, kind",Notes from the Underground
600,"people, to live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my",Notes from the Underground
600,life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the,Notes from the Underground
600,"tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world",Notes from the Underground
600,again.’”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in,Notes from the Underground
600,"my throat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay",Notes from the Underground
600,"and, bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart.",Notes from the Underground
600,I had reason to be troubled.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and,Notes from the Underground
600,"rending her heart, and—and the more I was convinced of it, the more",Notes from the Underground
600,eagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as,Notes from the Underground
600,possible. It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it,Notes from the Underground
600,was not merely sport....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I",Notes from the Underground
600,could not speak except “like a book.” But that did not trouble me: I,Notes from the Underground
600,"knew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness",Notes from the Underground
600,"might be an assistance. But now, having attained my effect, I was",Notes from the Underground
600,suddenly panic-stricken. Never before had I witnessed such despair! She,Notes from the Underground
600,"was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching",Notes from the Underground
600,it in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was,Notes from the Underground
600,shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her,Notes from the Underground
600,"bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed",Notes from the Underground
600,"closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living",Notes from the Underground
600,"soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her",Notes from the Underground
600,"hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers",Notes from the Underground
600,"into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint,",Notes from the Underground
600,"holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something,",Notes from the Underground
600,"begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at",Notes from the Underground
600,"once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the",Notes from the Underground
600,"dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I",Notes from the Underground
600,tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a,Notes from the Underground
600,box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as,Notes from the Underground
600,"the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a",Notes from the Underground
600,"contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost",Notes from the Underground
600,senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to,Notes from the Underground
600,"herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold",Notes from the Underground
600,"of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,” I began, but she",Notes from the Underground
600,squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the,Notes from the Underground
600,wrong thing and stopped.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“This is my address, Liza, come to me.”",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“I will come,” she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.”",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a",Notes from the Underground
600,"shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled",Notes from the Underground
600,herself in it to her chin. As she did this she gave another sickly,Notes from the Underground
600,"smile, blushed and looked at me strangely. I felt wretched; I was in",Notes from the Underground
600,haste to get away—to disappear.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Wait a minute,” she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,",Notes from the Underground
600,stopping me with her hand on my overcoat. She put down the candle in,Notes from the Underground
600,hot haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted,Notes from the Underground
600,"to show me something. As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and",Notes from the Underground
600,there was a smile on her lips—what was the meaning of it? Against my,Notes from the Underground
600,will I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that,Notes from the Underground
600,"seemed to ask forgiveness for something. In fact, it was not the same",Notes from the Underground
600,"face, not the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and",Notes from the Underground
600,"obstinate. Her eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time",Notes from the Underground
600,"trustful, caressing, timid. The expression with which children look at",Notes from the Underground
600,"people they are very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour. Her",Notes from the Underground
600,"eyes were a light hazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and",Notes from the Underground
600,capable of expressing love as well as sullen hatred.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must",Notes from the Underground
600,"understand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of",Notes from the Underground
600,paper to me. Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with,Notes from the Underground
600,"naive, almost childish, triumph. I unfolded it. It was a letter to her",Notes from the Underground
600,from a medical student or someone of that sort—a very high-flown and,Notes from the Underground
600,"flowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter. I don’t recall the",Notes from the Underground
600,"words now, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases",Notes from the Underground
600,"there was apparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned. When I",Notes from the Underground
600,"had finished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly",Notes from the Underground
600,impatient eyes fixed upon me. She fastened her eyes upon my face and,Notes from the Underground
600,"waited impatiently for what I should say. In a few words, hurriedly,",Notes from the Underground
600,"but with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that she had been",Notes from the Underground
600,"to a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of “very nice people,",Notes from the Underground
600,"_who knew nothing_, absolutely nothing, for she had only come here so",Notes from the Underground
600,lately and it had all happened ... and she hadn’t made up her mind to,Notes from the Underground
600,stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her debt...”,Notes from the Underground
600,and at that party there had been the student who had danced with her,Notes from the Underground
600,"all the evening. He had talked to her, and it turned out that he had",Notes from the Underground
600,"known her in old days at Riga when he was a child, they had played",Notes from the Underground
600,"together, but a very long time ago—and he knew her parents, but _about",Notes from the Underground
600,"this_ he knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion! And the",Notes from the Underground
600,day after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that letter,Notes from the Underground
600,through the friend with whom she had gone to the party ... and ...,Notes from the Underground
600,"well, that was all.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she,Notes from the Underground
600,finished.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"The poor girl was keeping that student’s letter as a precious treasure,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me",Notes from the Underground
600,"to go away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely",Notes from the Underground
600,"loved; that she, too, was addressed respectfully. No doubt that letter",Notes from the Underground
600,"was destined to lie in her box and lead to nothing. But none the less,",Notes from the Underground
600,I am certain that she would keep it all her life as a precious,Notes from the Underground
600,"treasure, as her pride and justification, and now at such a minute she",Notes from the Underground
600,had thought of that letter and brought it with naive pride to raise,Notes from the Underground
600,"herself in my eyes that I might see, that I, too, might think well of",Notes from the Underground
600,"her. I said nothing, pressed her hand and went out. I so longed to get",Notes from the Underground
600,"away ... I walked all the way home, in spite of the fact that the",Notes from the Underground
600,"melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes. I was exhausted,",Notes from the Underground
600,"shattered, in bewilderment. But behind the bewilderment the truth was",Notes from the Underground
600,already gleaming. The loathsome truth.,Notes from the Underground

600,VIII,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"It was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Waking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and",Notes from the Underground
600,"immediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was",Notes from the Underground
600,"positively amazed at my last night’s _sentimentality_ with Liza, at all",Notes from the Underground
600,those “outcries of horror and pity.” “To think of having such an attack,Notes from the Underground
600,"of womanish hysteria, pah!” I concluded. And what did I thrust my",Notes from the Underground
600,"address upon her for? What if she comes? Let her come, though; it",Notes from the Underground
600,"doesn’t matter.... But _obviously_, that was not now the chief and the",Notes from the Underground
600,most important matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my,Notes from the Underground
600,reputation in the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible;,Notes from the Underground
600,that was the chief business. And I was so taken up that morning that I,Notes from the Underground
600,actually forgot all about Liza.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before,Notes from the Underground
600,from Simonov. I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen,Notes from the Underground
600,roubles straight off from Anton Antonitch. As luck would have it he was,Notes from the Underground
600,"in the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the",Notes from the Underground
600,"first asking. I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU with",Notes from the Underground
600,"a swaggering air, I told him casually that the night before “I had been",Notes from the Underground
600,keeping it up with some friends at the Hôtel de Paris; we were giving a,Notes from the Underground
600,"farewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of my",Notes from the Underground
600,"childhood, and you know—a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt—of course,",Notes from the Underground
600,"he belongs to a good family, and has considerable means, a brilliant",Notes from the Underground
600,"career; he is witty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you understand; we",Notes from the Underground
600,drank an extra ‘half-dozen’ and ...”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily,",Notes from the Underground
600,unconstrainedly and complacently.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly,Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and",Notes from the Underground
600,"good-breeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I",Notes from the Underground
600,"blamed myself for all that had happened. I defended myself, “if I",Notes from the Underground
600,"really may be allowed to defend myself,” by alleging that being utterly",Notes from the Underground
600,"unaccustomed to wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass,",Notes from the Underground
600,"which I said, I had drunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for",Notes from the Underground
600,them at the Hôtel de Paris between five and six o’clock. I begged,Notes from the Underground
600,Simonov’s pardon especially; I asked him to convey my explanations to,Notes from the Underground
600,"all the others, especially to Zverkov, whom “I seemed to remember as",Notes from the Underground
600,though in a dream” I had insulted. I added that I would have called,Notes from the Underground
600,"upon all of them myself, but my head ached, and besides I had not the",Notes from the Underground
600,"face to. I was particularly pleased with a certain lightness, almost",Notes from the Underground
600,"carelessness (strictly within the bounds of politeness, however), which",Notes from the Underground
600,"was apparent in my style, and better than any possible arguments, gave",Notes from the Underground
600,them at once to understand that I took rather an independent view of,Notes from the Underground
600,“all that unpleasantness last night”; that I was by no means so utterly,Notes from the Underground
600,"crushed as you, my friends, probably imagine; but on the contrary,",Notes from the Underground
600,looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should look,Notes from the Underground
600,upon it. “On a young hero’s past no censure is cast!”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!” I thought,Notes from the Underground
600,"admiringly, as I read over the letter. “And it’s all because I am an",Notes from the Underground
600,intellectual and cultivated man! Another man in my place would not have,Notes from the Underground
600,"known how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as",Notes from the Underground
600,"jolly as ever again, and all because I am ‘a cultivated and educated",Notes from the Underground
600,"man of our day.’ And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine",Notes from the Underground
600,"yesterday. H’m!” ... No, it was not the wine. I did not drink anything",Notes from the Underground
600,at all between five and six when I was waiting for them. I had lied to,Notes from the Underground
600,Simonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn’t ashamed now....,Notes from the Underground
600,"Hang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid of it.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to",Notes from the Underground
600,"take it to Simonov. When he learned that there was money in the letter,",Notes from the Underground
600,Apollon became more respectful and agreed to take it. Towards evening I,Notes from the Underground
600,went out for a walk. My head was still aching and giddy after,Notes from the Underground
600,"yesterday. But as evening came on and the twilight grew denser, my",Notes from the Underground
600,"impressions and, following them, my thoughts, grew more and more",Notes from the Underground
600,"different and confused. Something was not dead within me, in the depths",Notes from the Underground
600,"of my heart and conscience it would not die, and it showed itself in",Notes from the Underground
600,acute depression. For the most part I jostled my way through the most,Notes from the Underground
600,"crowded business streets, along Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy",Notes from the Underground
600,Street and in Yusupov Garden. I always liked particularly sauntering,Notes from the Underground
600,"along these streets in the dusk, just when there were crowds of working",Notes from the Underground
600,"people of all sorts going home from their daily work, with faces",Notes from the Underground
600,"looking cross with anxiety. What I liked was just that cheap bustle,",Notes from the Underground
600,that bare prose. On this occasion the jostling of the streets irritated,Notes from the Underground
600,"me more than ever, I could not make out what was wrong with me, I could",Notes from the Underground
600,"not find the clue, something seemed rising up continually in my soul,",Notes from the Underground
600,"painfully, and refusing to be appeased. I returned home completely",Notes from the Underground
600,"upset, it was just as though some crime were lying on my conscience.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually. It seemed,Notes from the Underground
600,queer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented,Notes from the Underground
600,"me, as it were, especially, as it were, quite separately. Everything",Notes from the Underground
600,else I had quite succeeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it,Notes from the Underground
600,all and was still perfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov. But on,Notes from the Underground
600,this point I was not satisfied at all. It was as though I were worried,Notes from the Underground
600,"only by Liza. “What if she comes,” I thought incessantly, “well, it",Notes from the Underground
600,"doesn’t matter, let her come! H’m! it’s horrid that she should see, for",Notes from the Underground
600,"instance, how I live. Yesterday I seemed such a hero to her, while now,",Notes from the Underground
600,"h’m! It’s horrid, though, that I have let myself go so, the room looks",Notes from the Underground
600,like a beggar’s. And I brought myself to go out to dinner in such a,Notes from the Underground
600,suit! And my American leather sofa with the stuffing sticking out. And,Notes from the Underground
600,"my dressing-gown, which will not cover me, such tatters, and she will",Notes from the Underground
600,see all this and she will see Apollon. That beast is certain to insult,Notes from the Underground
600,"her. He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. And I, of",Notes from the Underground
600,"course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing and",Notes from the Underground
600,"scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall",Notes from the Underground
600,"begin smiling, telling lies. Oh, the beastliness! And it isn’t the",Notes from the Underground
600,"beastliness of it that matters most! There is something more important,",Notes from the Underground
600,"more loathsome, viler! Yes, viler! And to put on that dishonest lying",Notes from the Underground
600,mask again! ...”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“Why dishonest? How dishonest? I was speaking sincerely last night. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"remember there was real feeling in me, too. What I wanted was to excite",Notes from the Underground
600,"an honourable feeling in her.... Her crying was a good thing, it will",Notes from the Underground
600,have a good effect.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Yet I could not feel at ease. All that evening, even when I had come",Notes from the Underground
600,"back home, even after nine o’clock, when I calculated that Liza could",Notes from the Underground
600,"not possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came",Notes from the Underground
600,back to my mind always in the same position. One moment out of all that,Notes from the Underground
600,had happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment,Notes from the Underground
600,"when I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look",Notes from the Underground
600,"of torture. And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted",Notes from the Underground
600,"smile she had at that moment! But I did not know then, that fifteen",Notes from the Underground
600,"years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the",Notes from the Underground
600,"pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that",Notes from the Underground
600,minute.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to",Notes from the Underground
600,"over-excited nerves, and, above all, as _exaggerated_. I was always",Notes from the Underground
600,"conscious of that weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of",Notes from the Underground
600,"it. “I exaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,” I repeated to",Notes from the Underground
600,"myself every hour. But, however, “Liza will very likely come all the",Notes from the Underground
600,"same,” was the refrain with which all my reflections ended. I was so",Notes from the Underground
600,"uneasy that I sometimes flew into a fury: “She’ll come, she is certain",Notes from the Underground
600,"to come!” I cried, running about the room, “if not today, she will come",Notes from the Underground
600,tomorrow; she’ll find me out! The damnable romanticism of these pure,Notes from the Underground
600,"hearts! Oh, the vileness—oh, the silliness—oh, the stupidity of these",Notes from the Underground
600,"‘wretched sentimental souls!’ Why, how fail to understand? How could",Notes from the Underground

600,"But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"And how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how",Notes from the Underground
600,"little of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic",Notes from the Underground
600,too) had sufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, “to tell her all,” and",Notes from the Underground

600,"chanced to be near me at the time. I should have insulted her, have",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I",Notes from the Underground
600,began to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine,Notes from the Underground
600,"o’clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for",Notes from the Underground
600,"instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me",Notes from the Underground
600,"and my talking to her.... I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice",Notes from the Underground
600,"that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand",Notes from the Underground
600,"(I don’t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At",Notes from the Underground
600,"last all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings",Notes from the Underground
600,"herself at my feet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves",Notes from the Underground
600,"me better than anything in the world. I am amazed, but.... “Liza,” I",Notes from the Underground
600,"say, “can you imagine that I have not noticed your love? I saw it all,",Notes from the Underground
600,"I divined it, but I did not dare to approach you first, because I had",Notes from the Underground

600,"certain rights; so, h’m! Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to",Notes from the Underground
600,come!,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at",Notes from the Underground
600,that time by his rudeness. He drove me beyond all patience! He was the,Notes from the Underground
600,"bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been",Notes from the Underground
600,"squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated",Notes from the Underground
600,"him! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him,",Notes from the Underground
600,"especially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who",Notes from the Underground
600,worked part of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he,Notes from the Underground
600,"despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Though, indeed, he looked down upon everyone. Simply to glance at that",Notes from the Underground
600,"flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his",Notes from the Underground
600,"forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth,",Notes from the Underground
600,"compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was",Notes from the Underground
600,"confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the",Notes from the Underground
600,"most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with",Notes from the Underground
600,that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love,Notes from the Underground
600,"with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers—absolutely in",Notes from the Underground
600,"love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a",Notes from the Underground
600,"perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance",Notes from the Underground
600,"at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably",Notes from the Underground
600,ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the,Notes from the Underground
600,"air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything",Notes from the Underground
600,"for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything.",Notes from the Underground
600,There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on,Notes from the Underground
600,"earth, and that “he did not get rid of me” was simply that he could get",Notes from the Underground
600,wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven,Notes from the Underground
600,roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered,Notes from the Underground
600,from him. My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step,Notes from the Underground
600,almost threw me into convulsions. What I loathed particularly was his,Notes from the Underground
600,lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or something of that,Notes from the Underground
600,"sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it,",Notes from the Underground
600,"imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow,",Notes from the Underground
600,"measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the",Notes from the Underground
600,ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to,Notes from the Underground
600,himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading!,Notes from the Underground
600,"But he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow,",Notes from the Underground
600,"even, sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that",Notes from the Underground
600,that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over,Notes from the Underground
600,"the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at",Notes from the Underground
600,"that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were",Notes from the Underground
600,"chemically combined with my existence. Besides, nothing would have",Notes from the Underground
600,induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished,Notes from the Underground
600,"lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in",Notes from the Underground
600,"which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me,",Notes from the Underground
600,"for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I",Notes from the Underground
600,could not turn him away.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was",Notes from the Underground
600,"impossible. He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known",Notes from the Underground
600,where to hide my head. But I was so exasperated with everyone during,Notes from the Underground
600,"those days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some object",Notes from the Underground
600,to _punish_ Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that,Notes from the Underground
600,were owing him. I had for a long time—for the last two years—been,Notes from the Underground
600,"intending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself",Notes from the Underground
600,"airs with me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his",Notes from the Underground
600,"wages. I purposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely",Notes from the Underground
600,"silent indeed, in order to score off his pride and force him to be the",Notes from the Underground
600,first to speak of his wages. Then I would take the seven roubles out of,Notes from the Underground
600,"a drawer, show him I have the money put aside on purpose, but that I",Notes from the Underground
600,"won’t, I won’t, I simply won’t pay him his wages, I won’t just because",Notes from the Underground
600,"that is “what I wish,” because “I am master, and it is for me to",Notes from the Underground
600,"decide,” because he has been disrespectful, because he has been rude;",Notes from the Underground
600,but if he were to ask respectfully I might be softened and give it to,Notes from the Underground
600,"him, otherwise he might wait another fortnight, another three weeks, a",Notes from the Underground
600,whole month....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me. I could not hold out",Notes from the Underground
600,"for four days. He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there",Notes from the Underground
600,"had been such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be",Notes from the Underground
600,"observed I knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by",Notes from the Underground
600,"heart). He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare,",Notes from the Underground
600,"keeping it up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me",Notes from the Underground
600,or seeing me out of the house. If I held out and pretended not to,Notes from the Underground
600,"notice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further",Notes from the Underground
600,"tortures. All at once, _à propos_ of nothing, he would walk softly and",Notes from the Underground
600,"smoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand",Notes from the Underground
600,"at the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other,",Notes from the Underground
600,"and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous. If I",Notes from the Underground
600,"suddenly asked him what he wanted, he would make me no answer, but",Notes from the Underground
600,"continue staring at me persistently for some seconds, then, with a",Notes from the Underground
600,"peculiar compression of his lips and a most significant air,",Notes from the Underground
600,deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his room. Two hours,Notes from the Underground
600,later he would come out again and again present himself before me in,Notes from the Underground
600,the same way. It had happened that in my fury I did not even ask him,Notes from the Underground
600,"what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and imperiously and",Notes from the Underground
600,began staring back at him. So we stared at one another for two minutes;,Notes from the Underground
600,at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went back again for,Notes from the Underground
600,two hours.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my",Notes from the Underground
600,"revolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,",Notes from the Underground
600,deep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral,Notes from the Underground
600,"degradation, and, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing",Notes from the Underground
600,"completely: I raged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he",Notes from the Underground
600,wanted.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost,Notes from the Underground
600,my temper and flew at him in a fury. I was irritated beyond endurance,Notes from the Underground
600,apart from him.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Stay,” I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning,",Notes from the Underground
600,"with one hand behind his back, to go to his room. “Stay! Come back,",Notes from the Underground
600,"come back, I tell you!” and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he",Notes from the Underground
600,"turned round and even looked at me with some wonder. However, he",Notes from the Underground
600,"persisted in saying nothing, and that infuriated me.",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning round",Notes from the Underground
600,again.,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“If you have any order to give me it’s my duty to carry it out,” he",Notes from the Underground
600,"answered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp,",Notes from the Underground
600,raising his eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to,Notes from the Underground
600,"another, all this with exasperating composure.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“That’s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!” I shouted,",Notes from the Underground
600,turning crimson with anger. “I’ll tell you why you came here myself:,Notes from the Underground
600,"you see, I don’t give you your wages, you are so proud you don’t want",Notes from the Underground
600,"to bow down and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your",Notes from the Underground

600,"is—stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! ...”",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Listen,” I shouted to him. “Here’s the money, do you see, here it is,”",Notes from the Underground
600,(I took it out of the table drawer); “here’s the seven roubles,Notes from the Underground
600,"complete, but you are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ...",Notes from the Underground
600,going ... to ... have it until you come respectfully with bowed head to,Notes from the Underground
600,beg my pardon. Do you hear?”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“That cannot be,” he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“It shall be so,” I said, “I give you my word of honour, it shall be!”",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“And there’s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,” he went on, as",Notes from the Underground
600,"though he had not noticed my exclamations at all. “Why, besides, you",Notes from the Underground
600,"called me a ‘torturer,’ for which I can summon you at the",Notes from the Underground
600,police-station at any time for insulting behaviour.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Go, summon me,” I roared, “go at once, this very minute, this very",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud",Notes from the Underground

600,looking round.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,” I",Notes from the Underground
600,"decided inwardly. Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind",Notes from the Underground

600,slowly and violently.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Apollon,” I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless,",Notes from the Underground
600,“go at once without a minute’s delay and fetch the police-officer.”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles",Notes from the Underground

600,guffaw.,Notes from the Underground

600,"“At once, go this minute! Go on, or else you can’t imagine what will",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,“Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself? And as,Notes from the Underground
600,"for being frightened—you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Go!” I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder. I felt I should strike",Notes from the Underground
600,him in a minute.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open,Notes from the Underground
600,"at that instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at",Notes from the Underground
600,"us in perplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back",Notes from the Underground
600,"to my room. There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my",Notes from the Underground
600,head against the wall and stood motionless in that position.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Two minutes later I heard Apollon’s deliberate footsteps. “There is,Notes from the Underground
600,"some woman asking for you,” he said, looking at me with peculiar",Notes from the Underground

600,but stared at us sarcastically.,Notes from the Underground

600,"What made it worse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion,",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Sit down,” I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I",Notes from the Underground
600,sat down on the sofa. She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me,Notes from the Underground
600,"open-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once. This naïveté",Notes from the Underground
600,"of expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“You have found me in a strange position, Liza,” I began, stammering",Notes from the Underground
600,"and knowing that this was the wrong way to begin. “No, no, don’t",Notes from the Underground
600,"imagine anything,” I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed. “I am",Notes from the Underground
600,"not ashamed of my poverty.... On the contrary, I look with pride on my",Notes from the Underground

600,"to me or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle,",Notes from the Underground
600,which he had not yet threaded. I waited before him for three minutes,Notes from the Underground
600,with my arms crossed _à la Napoléon_. My temples were moist with sweat.,Notes from the Underground
600,"I was pale, I felt it. But, thank God, he must have been moved to pity,",Notes from the Underground
600,looking at me. Having threaded his needle he deliberately got up from,Notes from the Underground

600,"spectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over",Notes from the Underground
600,his shoulder: “Shall I get a whole portion?” deliberately walked out of,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,"“What is the matter? What is wrong?” she cried, fussing about me.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Water, give me water, over there!” I muttered in a faint voice, though",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment. At that moment",Notes from the Underground
600,Apollon brought in the tea. It suddenly seemed to me that this,Notes from the Underground
600,"commonplace, prosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,"of course, it was she who would have to pay for it. A horrible spite",Notes from the Underground
600,against her suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have,Notes from the Underground
600,killed her. To revenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word,Notes from the Underground
600,"to her all the time. “She is the cause of it all,” I thought.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Our silence lasted for five minutes. The tea stood on the table; we did,Notes from the Underground
600,not touch it. I had got to the point of purposely refraining from,Notes from the Underground
600,beginning in order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to,Notes from the Underground
600,begin alone. Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity.,Notes from the Underground
600,"I was obstinately silent. I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer,",Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground

600,unnecessary straightforwardness. But something hideous at once stifled,Notes from the Underground

600,all the time afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her,Notes from the Underground
600,"eyes wide open, shuddering with awful terror. The cynicism, the",Notes from the Underground
600,cynicism of my words overwhelmed her....,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Save you!” I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and down",Notes from the Underground
600,the room before her. “Save you from what? But perhaps I am worse than,Notes from the Underground
600,you myself. Why didn’t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving you,Notes from the Underground
600,that sermon: ‘But what did you come here yourself for? was it to read,Notes from the Underground
600,"us a sermon?’ Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I",Notes from the Underground
600,"wanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your",Notes from the Underground
600,"hysteria—that was what I wanted then! Of course, I couldn’t keep it up",Notes from the Underground
600,"then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the",Notes from the Underground
600,"devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I",Notes from the Underground
600,"got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I",Notes from the Underground
600,hated you already because of the lies I had told you. Because I only,Notes from the Underground
600,"like playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really",Notes from the Underground
600,want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I want,Notes from the Underground
600,"peace; yes, I’d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so",Notes from the Underground
600,"long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go",Notes from the Underground
600,without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I,Notes from the Underground
600,"always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that",Notes from the Underground
600,"I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been",Notes from the Underground
600,shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And,Notes from the Underground
600,do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That,Notes from the Underground
600,"I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched",Notes from the Underground
600,"torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was",Notes from the Underground
600,not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of,Notes from the Underground
600,"it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of",Notes from the Underground
600,"being found out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had",Notes from the Underground
600,been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you,Notes from the Underground
600,must realise that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this,Notes from the Underground
600,"wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful",Notes from the Underground
600,"cur. The saviour, the former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt",Notes from the Underground
600,"sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall",Notes from the Underground
600,never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before you,Notes from the Underground
600,"just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am",Notes from the Underground
600,"confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either! Yes—you must",Notes from the Underground
600,"answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I am a",Notes from the Underground
600,"blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most",Notes from the Underground
600,"envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am,",Notes from the Underground
600,"but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall",Notes from the Underground
600,"always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to",Notes from the Underground
600,"me that you don’t understand a word of this! And what do I care, what",Notes from the Underground
600,"do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you",Notes from the Underground
600,"understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been",Notes from the Underground
600,"here and listening. Why, it’s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out",Notes from the Underground
600,"like this, and then it is in hysterics! ... What more do you want? Why",Notes from the Underground
600,"do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying",Notes from the Underground
600,me? Why don’t you go?”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,But at this point a strange thing happened. I was so accustomed to,Notes from the Underground
600,"think and imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in",Notes from the Underground
600,"the world to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand,",Notes from the Underground
600,that I could not all at once take in this strange circumstance. What,Notes from the Underground
600,"happened was this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great",Notes from the Underground
600,deal more than I imagined. She understood from all this what a woman,Notes from the Underground
600,"understands first of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I",Notes from the Underground
600,was myself unhappy.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first by,Notes from the Underground
600,a look of sorrowful perplexity. When I began calling myself a scoundrel,Notes from the Underground
600,and a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied,Notes from the Underground
600,throughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively. She was on the,Notes from the Underground
600,point of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice,Notes from the Underground
600,"of my shouting: “Why are you here, why don’t you go away?” but realised",Notes from the Underground
600,"only that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this. Besides,",Notes from the Underground
600,"she was so crushed, poor girl; she considered herself infinitely",Notes from the Underground
600,beneath me; how could she feel anger or resentment? She suddenly leapt,Notes from the Underground
600,"up from her chair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands,",Notes from the Underground
600,"yearning towards me, though still timid and not daring to stir.... At",Notes from the Underground
600,this point there was a revulsion in my heart too. Then she suddenly,Notes from the Underground
600,"rushed to me, threw her arms round me and burst into tears. I, too,",Notes from the Underground
600,"could not restrain myself, and sobbed as I never had before.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,“They won’t let me ... I can’t be good!” I managed to articulate; then,Notes from the Underground
600,"I went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a",Notes from the Underground
600,"quarter of an hour in genuine hysterics. She came close to me, put her",Notes from the Underground
600,arms round me and stayed motionless in that position. But the trouble,Notes from the Underground
600,"was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the",Notes from the Underground
600,loathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust,Notes from the Underground
600,"into my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a",Notes from the Underground
600,"far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward",Notes from the Underground
600,now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was,Notes from the Underground
600,"I ashamed? I don’t know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into",Notes from the Underground
600,"my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that",Notes from the Underground
600,"she was now the heroine, while I was just a crushed and humiliated",Notes from the Underground
600,creature as she had been before me that night—four days before.... And,Notes from the Underground
600,all this came into my mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on,Notes from the Underground
600,the sofa.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,My God! surely I was not envious of her then.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I don’t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course,",Notes from the Underground
600,I was still less able to understand what I was feeling than now. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"cannot get on without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ...",Notes from the Underground
600,there is no explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to,Notes from the Underground
600,reason.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so sooner",Notes from the Underground
600,or later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because I,Notes from the Underground
600,was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled,Notes from the Underground
600,and flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession. My,Notes from the Underground
600,"eyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly. How I hated",Notes from the Underground
600,her and how I was drawn to her at that minute! The one feeling,Notes from the Underground
600,intensified the other. It was almost like an act of vengeance. At first,Notes from the Underground
600,"there was a look of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for",Notes from the Underground
600,one instant. She warmly and rapturously embraced me.,Notes from the Underground

600,,Notes from the Underground
600,A quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in,Notes from the Underground
600,"frenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and",Notes from the Underground
600,peeped through the crack at Liza. She was sitting on the ground with,Notes from the Underground
600,"her head leaning against the bed, and must have been crying. But she",Notes from the Underground
600,"did not go away, and that irritated me. This time she understood it",Notes from the Underground
600,"all. I had insulted her finally, but ... there’s no need to describe",Notes from the Underground
600,"it. She realised that my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a",Notes from the Underground
600,"fresh humiliation, and that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was",Notes from the Underground
600,"added now a _personal hatred_, born of envy.... Though I do not",Notes from the Underground
600,maintain positively that she understood all this distinctly; but she,Notes from the Underground
600,"certainly did fully understand that I was a despicable man, and what",Notes from the Underground
600,"was worse, incapable of loving her.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I know I shall be told that this is incredible—but it is incredible to,Notes from the Underground
600,be as spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange,Notes from the Underground
600,"I should not love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love. Why is it",Notes from the Underground
600,"strange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I",Notes from the Underground
600,"repeat, with me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral",Notes from the Underground
600,superiority. I have never in my life been able to imagine any other,Notes from the Underground
600,"sort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking",Notes from the Underground
600,that love really consists in the right—freely given by the beloved,Notes from the Underground
600,object—to tyrannise over her.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a,Notes from the Underground
600,struggle. I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral,Notes from the Underground
600,"subjugation, and afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated",Notes from the Underground
600,"object. And what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded",Notes from the Underground
600,"in so corrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with “real life,”",Notes from the Underground
600,"as to have actually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to",Notes from the Underground
600,shame for having come to me to hear “fine sentiments”; and did not even,Notes from the Underground
600,"guess that she had come not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me,",Notes from the Underground
600,"because to a woman all reformation, all salvation from any sort of",Notes from the Underground
600,"ruin, and all moral renewal is included in love and can only show",Notes from the Underground
600,itself in that form.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the room",Notes from the Underground
600,and peeping through the crack in the screen. I was only insufferably,Notes from the Underground
600,oppressed by her being here. I wanted her to disappear. I wanted,Notes from the Underground
600,"“peace,” to be left alone in my underground world. Real life oppressed",Notes from the Underground
600,me with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as",Notes from the Underground
600,though she were unconscious. I had the shamelessness to tap softly at,Notes from the Underground
600,"the screen as though to remind her.... She started, sprang up, and flew",Notes from the Underground
600,"to seek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape",Notes from the Underground
600,from me.... Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and,Notes from the Underground
600,"looked with heavy eyes at me. I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced,",Notes from the Underground
600,"however, to _keep up appearances_, and I turned away from her eyes.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Good-bye,” she said, going towards the door.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and",Notes from the Underground
600,closed it again. Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the,Notes from the Underground
600,"other corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway....",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,I did mean a moment since to tell a lie—to write that I did this,Notes from the Underground
600,"accidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through",Notes from the Underground
600,"losing my head. But I don’t want to lie, and so I will say straight out",Notes from the Underground
600,that I opened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite. It came,Notes from the Underground
600,into my head to do this while I was running up and down the room and,Notes from the Underground
600,she was sitting behind the screen. But this I can say for certain:,Notes from the Underground
600,"though I did that cruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the",Notes from the Underground
600,"heart, but came from my evil brain. This cruelty was so affected, so",Notes from the Underground
600,"purposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that",Notes from the Underground
600,I could not even keep it up a minute—first I dashed away to avoid,Notes from the Underground
600,"seeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza. I opened",Notes from the Underground
600,the door in the passage and began listening.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Liza! Liza!” I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.",Notes from the Underground
600,"There was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down on",Notes from the Underground
600,the stairs.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“Liza!” I cried, more loudly.",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,No answer. But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open,Notes from the Underground
600,heavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the,Notes from the Underground
600,stairs.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,She had gone. I went back to my room in hesitation. I felt horribly,Notes from the Underground
600,oppressed.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and",Notes from the Underground
600,"looked aimlessly before me. A minute passed, suddenly I started;",Notes from the Underground
600,"straight before me on the table I saw.... In short, I saw a crumpled",Notes from the Underground
600,"blue five-rouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute",Notes from the Underground
600,"before. It was the same note; it could be no other, there was no other",Notes from the Underground
600,in the flat. So she had managed to fling it from her hand on the table,Notes from the Underground
600,at the moment when I had dashed into the further corner.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Well! I might have expected that she would do that. Might I have,Notes from the Underground
600,"expected it? No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for",Notes from the Underground
600,my fellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so. I,Notes from the Underground
600,"could not endure it. A minute later I flew like a madman to dress,",Notes from the Underground
600,flinging on what I could at random and ran headlong after her. She,Notes from the Underground
600,could not have got two hundred paces away when I ran out into the,Notes from the Underground
600,street.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling,Notes from the Underground
600,"almost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as",Notes from the Underground
600,"though with a pillow. There was no one in the street, no sound was to",Notes from the Underground
600,be heard. The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer. I,Notes from the Underground
600,ran two hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,Where had she gone? And why was I running after her?,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"Why? To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to",Notes from the Underground
600,"entreat her forgiveness! I longed for that, my whole breast was being",Notes from the Underground
600,"rent to pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with",Notes from the Underground
600,"indifference. But—what for? I thought. Should I not begin to hate her,",Notes from the Underground
600,"perhaps, even tomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today?",Notes from the Underground
600,"Should I give her happiness? Had I not recognised that day, for the",Notes from the Underground
600,"hundredth time, what I was worth? Should I not torture her?",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered",Notes from the Underground
600,this.,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"“And will it not be better?” I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,",Notes from the Underground
600,stifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams. “Will it,Notes from the Underground
600,not be better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for,Notes from the Underground
600,"ever? Resentment—why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and",Notes from the Underground
600,painful consciousness! Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have,Notes from the Underground
600,"exhausted her heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in",Notes from the Underground
600,"her heart, and however loathsome the filth awaiting her—the feeling of",Notes from the Underground
600,"insult will elevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h’m! ... perhaps,",Notes from the Underground
600,"too, by forgiveness.... Will all that make things easier for her",Notes from the Underground
600,though? ...”,Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground

600,"is better—cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?",Notes from the Underground
600,,Notes from the Underground
600,"So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain",Notes from the Underground

600,there have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that,Notes from the Underground
600,I should turn back half-way? I never met Liza again and I have heard,Notes from the Underground
600,"nothing of her. I will add, too, that I remained for a long time",Notes from the Underground

600,"here? I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I",Notes from the Underground
600,have felt ashamed all the time I’ve been writing this story; so it’s,Notes from the Underground
600,"hardly literature so much as a corrective punishment. Why, to tell long",Notes from the Underground
600,"stories, showing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in",Notes from the Underground
600,"my corner, through lack of fitting environment, through divorce from",Notes from the Underground
600,"real life, and rankling spite in my underground world, would certainly",Notes from the Underground
600,"not be interesting; a novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an",Notes from the Underground
600,"anti-hero are _expressly_ gathered together here, and what matters",Notes from the Underground
600,"most, it all produces an unpleasant impression, for we are all divorced",Notes from the Underground
600,"from life, we are all cripples, every one of us, more or less. We are",Notes from the Underground
600,so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real,Notes from the Underground
600,"life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost",Notes from the Underground
600,"to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are",Notes from the Underground
600,all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and,Notes from the Underground
600,fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We,Notes from the Underground
600,don’t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant,Notes from the Underground
600,"prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a",Notes from the Underground
600,"little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our",Notes from the Underground
600,"activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should",Notes from the Underground
600,be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very,Notes from the Underground
600,"likely be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping.",Notes from the Underground
600,"Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your",Notes from the Underground
600,"underground holes, and don’t dare to say all of us—excuse me,",Notes from the Underground
600,"gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that “all of us.” As for",Notes from the Underground
600,what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an,Notes from the Underground
600,"extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what’s more, you",Notes from the Underground
600,"have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in",Notes from the Underground
600,"deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in",Notes from the Underground
600,"me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don’t even know",Notes from the Underground
600,"what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us",Notes from the Underground
600,alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We,Notes from the Underground
600,"shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and",Notes from the Underground
600,"what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at",Notes from the Underground
600,"being men—men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of",Notes from the Underground
600,"it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of",Notes from the Underground
600,"impossible generalised man. We are stillborn, and for generations past",Notes from the Underground
600,"have been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and",Notes from the Underground
600,better. We are developing a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be,Notes from the Underground
