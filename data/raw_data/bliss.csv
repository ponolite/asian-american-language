1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Very early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Crescent Bay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hills at the back were smothered. You could not see where they ended,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and the paddocks and bungalows began. The sandy road was gone and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,paddocks and bungalows the other side of it; there were no white dunes,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,covered with reddish grass beyond them; there was nothing to mark which,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was beach and where was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"blue. Big drops hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fluffy toi-toi was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the pinks in the bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Drenched were the cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nasturtium leaves. It looked as though the sea had beaten up softly in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the darkness, as though one immense wave had come rippling,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rippling—how far? Perhaps if you had waked up in the middle of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,night you might have seen a big fish flicking in at the window and gone,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,again....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Ah-Aah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came the sound,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping between the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smooth stones, gushing into ferny basins and out again; and there was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the splashing of big drops on large leaves, and something else—what was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it?—a faint stirring and shaking, the snapping of a twig and then such",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,silence that it seemed some one was listening.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Round the corner of Crescent Bay, between the piled-up masses of broken",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rock, a flock of sheep came pattering. They were huddled together, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"small, tossing, woolly mass, and their thin, stick-like legs trotted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,along quickly as if the cold and the quiet had frightened them. Behind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them an old sheep-dog, his soaking paws covered with sand, ran along",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with his nose to the ground, but carelessly, as if thinking of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,something else. And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"appeared. He was a lean, upright old man, in a frieze coat that was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"covered with a web of tiny drops, velvet trousers tied under the knee,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and a wide-awake with a folded blue handkerchief round the brim. One,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hand was crammed into his belt, the other grasped a beautifully smooth",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"yellow stick. And as he walked, taking his time, he kept up a very soft",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"light whistling, an airy, far-away fluting that sounded mournful and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tender. The old dog cut an ancient caper or two and then drew up sharp,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ashamed of his levity, and walked a few dignified paces by his master’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,side. The sheep ran forward in little pattering rushes; they began to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bleat, and ghostly flocks and herds answered them from under the sea.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Baa! Baaa!” For a time they seemed to be always on the same piece of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ground. There ahead was stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the same soaking bushes showed on either side and the same shadowy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,palings. Then something immense came into view; an enormous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shock-haired giant with his arms stretched out. It was the big gum-tree,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"outside Mrs. Stubbs’ shop, and as they passed by there was a strong",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,whiff of eucalyptus. And now big spots of light gleamed in the mist.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The shepherd stopped whistling; he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his wet sleeve and, screwing up his eyes, glanced in the direction of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the sea. The sun was rising. It was marvellous how quickly the mist,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thinned, sped away, dissolved from the shallow plain, rolled up from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the bush and was gone as if in a hurry to escape; big twists and curls,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,jostled and shouldered each other as the silvery beams broadened. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"far-away sky—a bright, pure blue—was reflected in the puddles, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"drops, swimming along the telegraph poles, flashed into points of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"light. Now the leaping, glittering sea was so bright it made one’s eyes",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ache to look at it. The shepherd drew a pipe, the bowl as small as an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"acorn, out of his breast pocket, fumbled for a chunk of speckled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tobacco, pared off a few shavings and stuffed the bowl. He was a grave,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fine-looking old man. As he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"head, the dog, watching, looked proud of him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Baa! Baaa!” The sheep spread out into a fan. They were just clear of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drowsy head; their cry sounded in the dreams of little children... who,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lifted their arms to drag down, to cuddle the darling little woolly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lambs of sleep. Then the first inhabitant appeared; it was the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Burnells’ cat Florrie, sitting on the gatepost, far too early as usual,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looking for their milk-girl. When she saw the old sheep-dog she sprang,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up quickly, arched her back, drew in her tabby head, and seemed to give",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a little fastidious shiver. “Ugh! What a coarse, revolting creature!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"said Florrie. But the old sheep-dog, not looking up, waggled past,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flinging out his legs from side to side. Only one of his ears twitched,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to prove that he saw, and thought her a silly young female.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wet black earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea. Myriads of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"birds were singing. A goldfinch flew over the shepherd’s head and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"perching on the tiptop of a spray, it turned to the sun, ruffling its",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"small breast feathers. And now they had passed the fisherman’s hut,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,passed the charred-looking little _whare_ where Leila the milk-girl,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lived with her old Gran. The sheep strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the sheep-dog, padded after, rounded them up and headed them for the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"steeper, narrower rocky pass that led out of Crescent Bay and towards",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Daylight Cove. “Baa! Baa!” Faint the cry came as they rocked along the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fast-drying road. The shepherd put away his pipe, dropping it into his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,breast-pocket so that the little bowl hung over. And straightway the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,soft airy whistling began again. Wag ran out along a ledge of rock,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after something that smelled, and ran back again disgusted. Then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pushing, nudging, hurrying, the sheep rounded the bend and the shepherd",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,followed after out of sight.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,II,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"figure in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down the paddock, cleared",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the stile, rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow, staggered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up the sandy hillock, and raced for dear life over the big porous",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stones, over the cold, wet pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like oil. Splish-Splosh! Splish-Splosh! The water bubbled round his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,legs as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting. First man in as usual! He’d,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beaten them all again. And he swooped down to souse his head and neck.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hail, brother! All hail, Thou Mighty One!” A velvety bass voice came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,booming over the water.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Great Scott! Damnation take it! Stanley lifted up to see a dark head,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bobbing far out and an arm lifted. It was Jonathan Trout—there before,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him! “Glorious morning!” sang the voice.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, very fine!” said Stanley briefly. Why the dickens didn’t the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fellow stick to his part of the sea? Why should he come barging over to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"this exact spot? Stanley gave a kick, a lunge and struck out, swimming",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"overarm. But Jonathan was a match for him. Up he came, his black hair",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sleek on his forehead, his short beard sleek.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I had an extraordinary dream last night!” he shouted.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What was the matter with the man? This mania for conversation irritated,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stanley beyond words. And it was always the same—always some piffle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"about a dream he’d had, or some cranky idea he’d got hold of, or some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rot he’d been reading. Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his legs till he was a living waterspout. But even then.... “I dreamed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I was hanging over a terrifically high cliff, shouting to some one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,below.” You would be! thought Stanley. He could stick no more of it. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stopped splashing. “Look here, Trout,” he said, “I’m in rather a hurry",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this morning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“You’re WHAT?” Jonathan was so surprised—or pretended to be—that he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sank under the water, then reappeared again blowing.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“All I mean is,” said Stanley, “I’ve no time to—to—to fool about. I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,want to get this over. I’m in a hurry. I’ve work to do this,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,morning—see?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Jonathan was gone before Stanley had finished. “Pass, friend!” said the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bass voice gently, and he slid away through the water with scarcely a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ripple.... But curse the fellow! He’d ruined Stanley’s bathe. What an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"unpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"then as quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the beach. He felt",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cheated.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Jonathan stayed a little longer in the water. He floated, gently moving",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his hands like fins, and letting the sea rock his long, skinny body. It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was curious, but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"True, he had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes, to poke fun at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"him, but at bottom he was sorry for the fellow. There was something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pathetic in his determination to make a job of everything. You couldn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"help feeling he’d be caught out one day, and then what an almighty",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cropper he’d come! At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"past him, and broke along the beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And now there came another. That was the way to live—carelessly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"recklessly, spending oneself. He got on to his feet and began to wade",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"towards the shore, pressing his toes into the firm, wrinkled sand. To",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"take things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of life, but to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,give way to it—that was what was needed. It was this tension that was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all wrong. To live—to live! And the perfect morning, so fresh and fair,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"basking in the light, as though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"whisper, “Why not?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ached all over; it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"him. And stalking up the beach, shivering, all his muscles tight, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,too felt his bathe was spoilt. He’d stayed in too long.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,III,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Beryl was alone in the living-room when Stanley appeared, wearing a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"blue serge suit, a stiff collar and a spotted tie. He looked almost",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,uncannily clean and brushed; he was going to town for the day. Dropping,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"into his chair, he pulled out his watch and put it beside his plate.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ve just got twenty-five minutes,” he said. “You might go and see if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the porridge is ready, Beryl?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mother’s just gone for it,” said Beryl. She sat down at the table and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,poured out his tea.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thanks!” Stanley took a sip. “Hallo!” he said in an astonished voice,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“you’ve forgotten the sugar.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, sorry!” But even then Beryl didn’t help him; she pushed the basin",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,across. What did this mean? As Stanley helped himself his blue eyes,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,widened; they seemed to quiver. He shot a quick glance at his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sister-in-law and leaned back.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Nothing wrong, is there?” he asked carelessly, fingering his collar.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Beryl’s head was bent; she turned her plate in her fingers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Nothing,” said her light voice. Then she too looked up, and smiled at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stanley. “Why should there be?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“O-oh! No reason at all as far as I know. I thought you seemed rather—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"At that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,each carrying a porridge plate. They were dressed alike in blue jerseys,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and knickers; their brown legs were bare, and each had her hair plaited",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and pinned up in what was called a horse’s tail. Behind them came Mrs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Fairfield with the tray.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Carefully, children,” she warned. But they were taking the very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,greatest care. They loved being allowed to carry things. “Have you said,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,good morning to your father?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, grandma.” They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and Beryl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good morning, Stanley!” Old Mrs. Fairfield gave him his plate.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Morning, mother! How’s the boy?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Splendid! He only woke up once last night. What a perfect morning!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The old woman paused, her hand on the loaf of bread, to gaze out of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,open door into the garden. The sea sounded. Through the wide-open,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,window streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,floor. Everything on the table flashed and glittered. In the middle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there was an old salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smiled, and a look of deep content shone in her eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You might _cut_ me a slice of that bread, mother,” said Stanley. “I’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,only twelve and a half minutes before the coach passes. Has anyone,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,given my shoes to the servant girl?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, they’re ready for you.” Mrs. Fairfield was quite unruffled.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Kezia! Why are you such a messy child!” cried Beryl despairingly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Me, Aunt Beryl?” Kezia stared at her. What had she done now? She had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"only dug a river down the middle of her porridge, filled it, and was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eating the banks away. But she did that every single morning, and no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,one had said a word up till now.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Why can’t you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie?” How,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,unfair grown-ups are!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But Lottie always makes a floating island, don’t you, Lottie?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t,” said Isabel smartly. “I just sprinkle mine with sugar and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,put on the milk and finish it. Only babies play with their food.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stanley pushed back his chair and got up.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Would you get me those shoes, mother? And, Beryl, if you’ve finished,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I wish you’d cut down to the gate and stop the coach. Run in to your,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mother, Isabel, and ask her where my bowler hat’s been put. Wait a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,minute—have you children been playing with my stick?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, father!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But I put it here.” Stanley began to bluster. “I remember distinctly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"putting it in this corner. Now, who’s had it? There’s no time to lose.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Look sharp! The stick’s got to be found.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Even Alice, the servant-girl, was drawn into the chase. “You haven’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,been using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying. “Most,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extraordinary thing. I can’t keep a single possession to myself.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They’ve made away with my stick, now!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Stick, dear? What stick?” Linda’s vagueness on these occasions could",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"not be real, Stanley decided. Would nobody sympathize with him?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Coach! Coach, Stanley!” Beryl’s voice cried from the gate.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stanley waved his arm to Linda. “No time to say good-bye!” he cried.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And he meant that as a punishment to her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He snatched his bowler hat, dashed out of the house, and swung down the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"garden path. Yes, the coach was there waiting, and Beryl, leaning over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the open gate, was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had happened. The heartlessness of women! The way they took it for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,granted it was your job to slave away for them while they didn’t even,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,take the trouble to see that your walking-stick wasn’t lost. Kelly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,trailed his whip across the horses.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good-bye, Stanley,” called Beryl, sweetly and gaily. It was easy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"enough to say good-bye! And there she stood, idle, shading her eyes",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with her hand. The worst of it was Stanley had to shout good-bye too,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for the sake of appearances. Then he saw her turn, give a little skip",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and run back to the house. She was glad to be rid of him!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Yes, she was thankful. Into the living-room she ran and called “He’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gone!” Linda cried from her room: “Beryl! Has Stanley gone?” Old Mrs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fairfield appeared, carrying the boy in his little flannel coatee.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Gone?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Gone!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, the relief, the difference it made to have the man out of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,house. Their very voices were changed as they called to one another;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they sounded warm and loving and as if they shared a secret. Beryl went,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over to the table. “Have another cup of tea, mother. It’s still hot.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She wanted, somehow, to celebrate the fact that they could do what they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,liked now. There was no man to disturb them; the whole perfect day was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,theirs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“No, thank you, child,” said old Mrs. Fairfield, but the way at that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,moment she tossed the boy up and said “a-goos-a-goos-a-ga!” to him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meant that she felt the same. The little girls ran into the paddock,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like chickens let out of a coop.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Even Alice, the servant-girl, washing up the dishes in the kitchen,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,caught the infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,reckless fashion.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, these men!” said she, and she plunged the teapot into the bowl and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"held it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling, as if it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,too was a man and drowning was too good for them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Wait for me, Isa-bel! Kezia, wait for me!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There was poor little Lottie, left behind again, because she found it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so fearfully hard to get over the stile by herself. When she stood on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the first step her knees began to wobble; she grasped the post. Then,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you had to put one leg over. But which leg? She never could decide. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,when she did finally put one leg over with a sort of stamp of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,despair—then the feeling was awful. She was half in the paddock still,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and half in the tussock grass. She clutched the post desperately and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lifted up her voice. “Wait for me!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, don’t you wait for her, Kezia!” said Isabel. “She’s such a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,silly. She’s always making a fuss. Come on!” And she tugged Kezia’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"jersey. “You can use my bucket if you come with me,” she said kindly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“It’s bigger than yours.” But Kezia couldn’t leave Lottie all by,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,herself. She ran back to her. By this time Lottie was very red in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,face and breathing heavily.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, put your other foot over,” said Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Where?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Here where my hand is.” Kezia patted the place.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, _there_ do you mean!” Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the second",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,foot over.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Now—sort of turn round and sit down and slide,” said Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But there’s nothing to sit down _on_, Kezia,” said Lottie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She managed it at last, and once it was over she shook herself and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,began to beam.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“I’m getting better at climbing over stiles, aren’t I, Kezia?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabel’s bright red sunbonnet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up that sliding, slipping hill. At the top they paused to decide where",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to go and to have a good stare at who was there already. Seen from,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"behind, standing against the skyline, gesticulating largely with their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"spades, they looked like minute puzzled explorers.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lady-help, who sat on a camp-stool and kept order with a whistle that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she wore tied round her neck, and a small cane with which she directed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,operations. The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"their own game. If they did, it ended in the boys pouring water down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the girls’ necks or the girls trying to put little black crabs into the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,boys’ pockets. So Mrs. S. J. and the poor lady-help drew up what she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,called a “brogramme” every morning to keep them “abused and out of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bischief.” It was all competitions or races or round games. Everything,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,began with a piercing blast of the lady-help’s whistle and ended with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"another. There were even prizes—large, rather dirty paper parcels which",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the lady-help with a sour little smile drew out of a bulging string,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kit. The Samuel Josephs fought fearfully for the prizes and cheated and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pinched one another’s arms—they were all expert pinchers. The only time,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the Burnell children ever played with them Kezia had got a prize, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,when she undid three bits of paper she found a very small rusty,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,button-hook. She couldn’t understand why they made such a fuss....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,parties. The Samuel Josephs were always giving children’s parties at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the Bay and there was always the same food. A big washhand basin of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very brown fruit-salad, buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,something the lady-help called “Limmonadear.” And you went away in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,evening with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all down the front of your open-work pinafore, leaving the Samuel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephs leaping like savages on their lawn. No! They were too awful.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"On the other side of the beach, close down to the water, two little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"boys, their knickers rolled up, twinkled like spiders. One was digging,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the other pattered in and out of the water, filling a small bucket.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They were the Trout boys, Pip and Rags. But Pip was so busy digging and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Rags was so busy helping that they didn’t see their little cousins,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,until they were quite close.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Look!” said Pip. “Look what I’ve discovered.” And he showed them an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"old wet, squashed-looking boot. The three little girls stared.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Whatever are you going to do with it?” asked Kezia.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Keep it, of course!” Pip was very scornful. “It’s a find—see?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Yes, Kezia saw that. All the same....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There’s lots of things buried in the sand,” explained Pip. “They get",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chucked up from wrecks. Treasure. Why—you might find—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in?” asked Lottie.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, that’s to moisten it,” said Pip, “to make the work a bit easier.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Keep it up, Rags.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And good little Rags ran up and down, pouring in the water that turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brown like cocoa.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, shall I show you what I found yesterday?” said Pip mysteriously,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and he stuck his spade into the sand. “Promise not to tell.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Is it really, Pip?” Even Isabel was impressed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pip’s fingers. Aunt Beryl had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a nemeral in a ring, but it was a very small one. This one was as big",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as a star and far more beautiful.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,As the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sand-hills,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and came down on the beach to bathe. It was understood that at eleven,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,o’clock the women and children of the summer colony had the sea to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"themselves. First the women undressed, pulled on their bathing dresses",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and covered their heads in hideous caps like sponge bags; then the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,children were unbuttoned. The beach was strewn with little heaps of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"clothes and shoes; the big summer hats, with stones on them to keep",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them from blowing away, looked like immense shells. It was strange that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even the sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"laughing figures ran into the waves. Old Mrs. Fairfield, in a lilac",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cotton dress and a black hat tied under the chin, gathered her little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brood and got them ready. The little Trout boys whipped their shirts,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over their heads, and away the five sped, while their grandma sat with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,one hand in her knitting-bag ready to draw out the ball of wool when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she was satisfied they were safely in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"delicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering, crouching down,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"slapping the water, never hesitated. But Isabel, who could swim twelve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strokes, and Kezia, who could nearly swim eight, only followed on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strict understanding they were not to be splashed. As for Lottie, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"didn’t follow at all. She liked to be left to go in her own way,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"please. And that way was to sit down at the edge of the water, her legs",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"straight, her knees pressed together, and to make vague motions with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her arms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea. But when a bigger,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wave than usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"direction, she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the beach again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, mother, keep those for me, will you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Two rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfield’s lap.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, dear. But aren’t you going to bathe here?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No-o,” Beryl drawled. She sounded vague. “I’m undressing farther",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,along. I’m going to bathe with Mrs. Harry Kember.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Very well.” But Mrs. Fairfield’s lips set. She disapproved of Mrs,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Harry Kember. Beryl knew it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Poor old mother, she smiled, as she skimmed over the stones. Poor old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mother! Old! Oh, what joy, what bliss it was to be young....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You look very pleased,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. She sat hunched up on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the stones, her arms round her knees, smoking.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s such a lovely day,” said Beryl, smiling down at her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh my _dear_!” Mrs. Harry Kember’s voice sounded as though she knew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,better than that. But then her voice always sounded as though she knew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something better about you than you did yourself. She was a long,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. Her face, too, was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,long and narrow and exhausted-looking; even her fair curled fringe,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked burnt out and withered. She was the only woman at the Bay who,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smoked, and she smoked incessantly, keeping the cigarette between her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lips while she talked, and only taking it out when the ash was so long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you could not understand why it did not fall. When she was not playing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bridge—she played bridge every day of her life—she spent her time lying,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in the full glare of the sun. She could stand any amount of it; she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"never had enough. All the same, it did not seem to warm her. Parched,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"withered, cold, she lay stretched on the stones like a piece of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tossed-up driftwood. The women at the Bay thought she was very, very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fast. Her lack of vanity, her slang, the way she treated men as though",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she was one of them, and the fact that she didn’t care twopence about",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her house and called the servant Gladys “Glad-eyes,” was disgraceful.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Standing on the veranda steps Mrs. Kember would call in her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"indifferent, tired voice, “I say, Glad-eyes, you might heave me a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"handkerchief if I’ve got one, will you?” And Glad-eyes, a red bow in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her hair instead of a cap, and white shoes, came running with an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"impudent smile. It was an absolute scandal! True, she had no children,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and her husband.... Here the voices were always raised; they became,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fervent. How can he have married her? How can he, how can he? It must",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"have been money, of course, but even then!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mrs. Kember’s husband was at least ten years younger than she was, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"illustration in an American novel rather than a man. Black hair, dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"blue eyes, red lips, a slow sleepy smile, a fine tennis player, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"perfect dancer, and with it all a mystery. Harry Kember was like a man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"walking in his sleep. Men couldn’t stand him, they couldn’t get a word",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out of the chap; he ignored his wife just as she ignored him. How did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he live? Of course there were stories, but such stories! They simply",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"couldn’t be told. The women he’d been seen with, the places he’d been",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"seen in... but nothing was ever certain, nothing definite. Some of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"women at the Bay privately thought he’d commit a murder one day. Yes,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,even while they talked to Mrs. Kember and took in the awful concoction,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she was wearing, they saw her, stretched as she lay on the beach; but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cold, bloody, and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mouth.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mrs. Kember rose, yawned, unsnapped her belt buckle, and tugged at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tape of her blouse. And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"jersey, and stood up in her short white petticoat, and her camisole",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with ribbon bows on the shoulders.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mercy on us,” said Mrs. Harry Kember, “what a little beauty you are!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Don’t!” said Beryl softly; but, drawing off one stocking and then the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other, she felt a little beauty.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My dear—why not?” said Mrs. Harry Kember, stamping on her own",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,petticoat. Really—her underclothes! A pair of blue cotton knickers and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillow-case.... “And you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"don’t wear stays, do you?” She touched Beryl’s waist, and Beryl sprang",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,away with a small affected cry. Then “Never!” she said firmly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Lucky little creature,” sighed Mrs. Kember, unfastening her own.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Beryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,who is trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathing-dress,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all at one and the same time.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, my dear—don’t mind me,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. “Why be shy? I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shan’t eat you. I shan’t be shocked like those other ninnies.” And she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Beryl was shy. She never undressed in front of anybody. Was that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"silly? Mrs. Harry Kember made her feel it was silly, even something to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be ashamed of. Why be shy indeed! She glanced quickly at her friend,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,standing so boldly in her torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast. Laughing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"recklessly, she drew on the limp, sandy-feeling bathing-dress that was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not quite dry and fastened the twisted buttons.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s better,” said Mrs. Harry Kember. They began to go down the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"beach together. “Really, it’s a sin for you to wear clothes, my dear.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Somebody’s got to tell you some day.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The water was quite warm. It was that marvellous transparent blue,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flecked with silver, but the sand at the bottom looked gold; when you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kicked with your toes there rose a little puff of gold-dust. Now the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"waves just reached her breast. Beryl stood, her arms outstretched,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gazing out, and as each wave came she gave the slightest little jump,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so that it seemed it was the wave which lifted her so gently.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I believe in pretty girls having a good time,” said Mrs. Harry Kember.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Why not? Don’t you make a mistake, my dear. Enjoy yourself.” And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"suddenly she turned turtle, disappeared, and swam away quickly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"quickly, like a rat. Then she flicked round and began swimming back.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She was going to say something else. Beryl felt that she was being,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"poisoned by this cold woman, but she longed to hear. But oh, how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strange, how horrible! As Mrs. Harry Kember came up close she looked,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in her black waterproof bathing-cap, with her sleepy face lifted above",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"front grass patch, Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away. She did",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nothing. She looked up at the dark, close, dry leaves of the manuka, at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the chinks of blue between, and now and again a tiny yellowish flower",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dropped on her. Pretty—yes, if you held one of those flowers on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"palm of your hand and looked at it closely, it was an exquisite small",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thing. Each pale yellow petal shone as if each was the careful work of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a loving hand. The tiny tongue in the centre gave it the shape of a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bell. And when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But as soon as they flowered, they fell and were scattered. You brushed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"looked more like a shadow than like real hair, but his ear was a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bright, deep coral. Linda clasped her hands above her head and crossed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her feet. It was very pleasant to know that all these bungalows were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"empty, that everybody was down on the beach, out of sight, out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hearing. She had the garden to herself; she was alone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Dazzling white the picotees shone; the golden-eyed marigold glittered;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. If,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"only one had time to look at these flowers long enough, time to get",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over the sense of novelty and strangeness, time to know them! But as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"soon as one paused to part the petals, to discover the under-side of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the leaf, along came Life and one was swept away. And, lying in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cane chair, Linda felt so light; she felt like a leaf. Along came Life",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like a wind and she was seized and shaken; she had to go. Oh dear,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would it always be so? Was there no escape?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home, leaning against",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her father’s knee. And he promised, “As soon as you and I are old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"enough, Linny, we’ll cut off somewhere, we’ll escape. Two boys",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,together. I have a fancy I’d like to sail up a river in China.” Linda,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw that river, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. She saw",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the yellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high, thin voices as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they called....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, papa.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"slowly past their house, and slowly, solemnly even, uncovered. Linda’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"father pulled her ear teasingly, in the way he had.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Linny’s beau,” he whispered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, papa, fancy being married to Stanley Burnell!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Well, she was married to him. And what was more she loved him. Not the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Stanley whom every one saw, not the everyday one; but a timid,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sensitive, innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"prayers, and who longed to be good. Stanley was simple. If he believed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in people—as he believed in her, for instance—it was with his whole",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,heart. He could not be disloyal; he could not tell a lie. And how,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,terribly he suffered if he thought anyone—she—was not being dead,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"straight, dead sincere with him! “This is too subtle for me!” He flung",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out the words, but his open, quivering, distraught look was like the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,look of a trapped beast.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But the trouble was—here Linda felt almost inclined to laugh, though",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Heaven knows it was no laughing matter—she saw _her_ Stanley so seldom.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There were glimpses, moments, breathing spaces of calm, but all the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rest of the time it was like living in a house that couldn’t be cured,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of the habit of catching on fire, on a ship that got wrecked every day.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And it was always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger. Her whole,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"time was spent in rescuing him, and restoring him, and calming him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"down, and listening to his story. And what was left of her time was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,spent in the dread of having children.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Linda frowned; she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ankles. Yes, that was her real grudge against life; that was what she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"could not understand. That was the question she asked and asked, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,listened in vain for the answer. It was all very well to say it was the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"common lot of women to bear children. It wasn’t true. She, for one,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"could prove that wrong. She was broken, made weak, her courage was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gone, through child-bearing. And what made it doubly hard to bear was,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she did not love her children. It was useless pretending. Even if she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had had the strength she never would have nursed and played with the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little girls. No, it was as though a cold breath had chilled her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through and through on each of those awful journeys; she had no warmth,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"left to give them. As to the boy—well, thank Heaven, mother had taken",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"him; he was mother’s, or Beryl’s, or anybody’s who wanted him. She had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hardly held him in her arms. She was so indifferent about him that as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he lay there... Linda glanced down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The boy had turned over. He lay facing her, and he was no longer",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"asleep. His dark-blue, baby eyes were open; he looked as though he was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,peeping at his mother. And suddenly his face dimpled; it broke into a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wide, toothless smile, a perfect beam, no less.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I’m here!” that happy smile seemed to say. “Why don’t you like me?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There was something so quaint, so unexpected about that smile that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Linda smiled herself. But she checked herself and said to the boy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"coldly, “I don’t like babies.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t like babies?” The boy couldn’t believe her. “Don’t like _me_?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He waved his arms foolishly at his mother.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Linda dropped off her chair on to the grass.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Why do you keep on smiling?” she said severely. “If you knew what I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was thinking about, you wouldn’t.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But he only squeezed up his eyes, slyly, and rolled his head on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pillow. He didn’t believe a word she said.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“We know all about that!” smiled the boy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Linda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ah no, be sincere. That was not what she felt; it was something far",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"different, it was something so new, so.... The tears danced in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eyes; she breathed in a small whisper to the boy, “Hallo, my funny!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But by now the boy had forgotten his mother. He was serious again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Something pink, something soft waved in front of him. He made a grab at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it and it immediately disappeared. But when he lay back, another, like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the first, appeared. This time he determined to catch it. He made a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tremendous effort and rolled right over.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,VII,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The tide was out; the beach was deserted; lazily flopped the warm sea.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The sun beat down, beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand, baking the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grey and blue and black and white-veined pebbles. It sucked up the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little drop of water that lay in the hollow of the curved shells; it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bleached the pink convolvulus that threaded through and through the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sand-hills. Nothing seemed to move but the small sand-hoppers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Pit-pit-pit! They were never still.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Over there on the weed-hung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"beasts come down to the water to drink, the sunlight seemed to spin",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like a silver coin dropped into each of the small rock pools. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"danced, they quivered, and minute ripples laved the porous shores.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Looking down, bending over, each pool was like a lake with pink and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,blue houses clustered on the shores; and oh! the vast mountainous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"country behind those houses—the ravines, the passes, the dangerous",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,creeks and fearful tracks that led to the water’s edge. Underneath,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"waved the sea-forest—pink thread-like trees, velvet anemones, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"orange berry-spotted weeds. Now a stone on the bottom moved, rocked,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and there was a glimpse of a black feeler; now a thread-like creature,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wavered by and was lost. Something was happening to the pink, waving",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,trees; they were changing to a cold moonlight blue. And now there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sounded the faintest “plop.” Who made that sound? What was going on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"down there? And how strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sun....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony. Over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the verandas, prone on the paddock, flung over the fences, there were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,exhausted-looking bathing-dresses and rough striped towels. Each back,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,window seemed to have a pair of sand-shoes on the sill and some lumps,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of rock or a bucket or a collection of pawa shells. The bush quivered,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in a haze of heat; the sandy road was empty except for the Trouts’ dog,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Snooker, who lay stretched in the very middle of it. His blue eye was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"turned up, his legs stuck out stiffly, and he gave an occasional",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"desperate-sounding puff, as much as to say he had decided to make an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,end of it and was only waiting for some kind cart to come along.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What are you looking at, my grandma? Why do you keep stopping and sort",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of staring at the wall?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together. The little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girl, wearing only her short drawers and her under-bodice, her arms and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"legs bare, lay on one of the puffed-up pillows of her grandma’s bed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and the old woman, in a white ruffled dressing-gown, sat in a rocker at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the window, with a long piece of pink knitting in her lap. This room",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that they shared, like the other rooms of the bungalow, was of light",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,varnished wood and the floor was bare. The furniture was of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shabbiest, the simplest. The dressing-table, for instance, was a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"packing-case in a sprigged muslin petticoat, and the mirror above was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,very strange; it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"imprisoned in it. On the table there stood a jar of sea-pinks, pressed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"so tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"special shell which Kezia had given her grandma for a pin-tray, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,another even more special which she had thought would make a very nice,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,place for a watch to curl up in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tell me, grandma,” said Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“I was thinking of your Uncle William, darling,” she said quietly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“That was the one.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, what happened to him?” Kezia knew perfectly well, but she wanted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to be told again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,over like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Does it make you sad to think about him, grandma?” She hated her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grandma to be sad.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was the old woman’s turn to consider. Did it make her sad? To look,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back, back. To stare down the years, as Kezia had seen her doing. To",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"look after _them_ as a woman does, long after _they_ were out of sight.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Did it make her sad? No, life was like that.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, Kezia.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But why?” asked Kezia. She lifted one bare arm and began to draw,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,things in the air. “Why did Uncle William have to die? He wasn’t old.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Mrs. Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes. “It just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"happened,” she said in an absorbed voice.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Some day, my darling.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, grandma.” Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes. They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,felt sandy. “What if I just won’t?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We’re not asked, Kezia,” she said sadly. “It happens to all of us",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sooner or later.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kezia lay still thinking this over. She didn’t want to die. It meant,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she would have to leave here, leave everywhere, for ever, leave—leave",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her grandma. She rolled over quickly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“What, my pet!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"Burnells’ shut with a bang, and a very gay figure walked down the path",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to the gate. It was Alice, the servant-girl, dressed for her afternoon",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out. She wore a white cotton dress with such large red spots on it and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"so many that they made you shudder, white shoes and a leghorn turned up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"under the brim with poppies. Of course she wore gloves, white ones,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stained at the fastenings with iron-mould, and in one hand she carried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a very dashed-looking sunshade which she referred to as her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_perishall_.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Beryl, sitting in the window, fanning her freshly-washed hair, thought",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"a piece of cork before she started out, the picture would have been",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,complete. And where did a girl like that go to in a place like this?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The heart-shaped Fijian fan beat scornfully at that lovely bright mane.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She supposed Alice had picked up some horrible common larrikin and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they’d go off into the bush together. Pity to have made herself so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,conspicuous; they’d have hard work to hide with Alice in that rig-out.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But no, Beryl was unfair. Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs, who’d",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sent her an “invite” by the little boy who called for orders. She had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,taken ever such a liking to Mrs. Stubbs ever since the first time she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,went to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Dear heart!” Mrs. Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side. “I never,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,seen anyone so eaten. You might have been attacked by canningbals.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Alice did wish there’d been a bit of life on the road though. Made her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"feel so queer, having nobody behind her. Made her feel all weak in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,spine. She couldn’t believe that some one wasn’t watching her. And yet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it was silly to turn round; it gave you away. She pulled up her gloves,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hummed to herself and said to the distant gum-tree, “Shan’t be long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,now.” But that was hardly company.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"On the veranda there hung a long string of bathing-dresses, clinging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,together as though they’d just been rescued from the sea rather than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"waiting to go in, and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extraordinarily mixed that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,forcibly separate at least fifty. Even then it was the rarest thing to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,find the left that belonged to the right. So many people had lost,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,patience and gone off with one shoe that fitted and one that was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little too big.... Mrs. Stubbs prided herself on keeping something of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everything. The two windows, arranged in the form of precarious",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Alice pressed open the door. The bell jangled, the red serge curtains",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"parted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. With her broad smile and the long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bacon knife in her hand, she looked like a friendly brigand. Alice was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,welcomed so warmly that she found it quite difficult to keep up her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“manners.” They consisted of persistent little coughs and hems, pulls",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at her gloves, tweaks at her skirt, and a curious difficulty in seeing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,what was set before her or understanding what was said.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Tea was laid on the parlour table—ham, sardines, a whole pound of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"butter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,advertisement for somebody’s baking-powder. But the Primus stove roared,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so loudly that it was useless to try to talk above it. Alice sat down,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on the edge of a basket-chair while Mrs. Stubbs pumped the stove still,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,higher. Suddenly Mrs. Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,disclosed a large brown-paper parcel.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ve just had some new photers taken, my dear,” she shouted cheerfully",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to Alice. “Tell me what you think of them.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"In a very dainty, refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,back from the first one. Life! How many there were! There were three,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dozzing at least. And she held it up to the light.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mrs. Stubbs sat in an arm-chair, leaning very much to one side. There",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was a look of mild astonishment on her large face, and well there might",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"be. For though the arm-chair stood on a carpet, to the left of it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"miraculously skirting the carpet-border, there was a dashing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,water-fall. On her right stood a Grecian pillar with a giant fern-tree,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on either side of it, and in the background towered a gaunt mountain,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pale with snow.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It is a nice style, isn’t it?” shouted Mrs. Stubbs; and Alice had just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"screamed “Sweetly” when the roaring of the Primus stove died down,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fizzled out, ceased, and she said “Pretty” in a silence that was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,frightening.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Draw up your chair, my dear,” said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour out.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes,” she said thoughtfully, as she handed the tea, “but I don’t care",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about the size. I’m having an enlargemint. All very well for Christmas,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cards, but I never was the one for small photers myself. You get no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"comfort out of them. To say the truth, I find them dis’eartening.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Alice quite saw what she meant.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Size,” said Mrs. Stubbs. “Give me size. That was what my poor dear",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,husband was always saying. He couldn’t stand anything small. Gave him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the creeps. And, strange as it may seem, my dear”—here Mrs. Stubbs",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,creaked and seemed to expand herself at the memory—“it was dropsy that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,carried him off at the larst. Many’s the time they drawn one and a half,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pints from ’im at the ’ospital... It seemed like a judgmint.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Alice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ventured, “I suppose it was water.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Mrs. Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly, “It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was _liquid_, my dear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Liquid! Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nosing and wary.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s ’im!” said Mrs. Stubbs, and she pointed dramatically to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,life-size head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead white rose in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the buttonhole of his coat that made you think of a curl of cold,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mutting fat. Just below, in silver letters on a red cardboard ground,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were the words, “Be not afraid, it is I.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s ever such a fine face,” said Alice faintly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The pale-blue bow on the top of Mrs. Stubbs’s fair frizzy hair,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quivered. She arched her plump neck. What a neck she had! It was bright,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pink where it began and then it changed to warm apricot, and that faded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to the colour of a brown egg and then to a deep creamy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“All the same, my dear,” she said surprisingly, “freedom’s best!” Her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"soft, fat chuckle sounded like a purr. “Freedom’s best,” said Mrs.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Stubbs again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Freedom! Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. She felt awkward. Her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mind flew back to her own kitching. Ever so queer! She wanted to be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,back in it again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,IX,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A strange company assembled in the Burnells’ washhouse after tea. Round,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the table there sat a bull, a rooster, a donkey that kept forgetting it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was a donkey, a sheep and a bee. The washhouse was the perfect place",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for such a meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and nobody ever interrupted. It was a small tin shed standing apart,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,from the bungalow. Against the wall there was a deep trough and in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,corner a copper with a basket of clothes-pegs on top of it. The little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"window, spun over with cobwebs, had a piece of candle and a mouse-trap",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on the dusty sill. There were clotheslines criss-crossed overhead and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hanging from a peg on the wall, a very big, a huge, rusty horseshoe.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The table was in the middle with a form at either side.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You can’t be a bee, Kezia. A bee’s not an animal. It’s a ninseck.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, but I do want to be a bee frightfully,” wailed Kezia.... A tiny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bee, all yellow-furry, with striped legs. She drew her legs up under",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her and leaned over the table. She felt she was a bee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A ninseck must be an animal,” she said stoutly. “It makes a noise.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It’s not like a fish.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m a bull, I’m a bull!” cried Pip. And he gave such a tremendous",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bellow—how did he make that noise?—that Lottie looked quite alarmed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ll be a sheep,” said little Rags. “A whole lot of sheep went past",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this morning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How do you know?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Dad heard them. Baa!” He sounded like the little lamb that trots,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,behind and seems to wait to be carried.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Cock-a-doodle-do!” shrilled Isabel. With her red cheeks and bright,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eyes she looked like a rooster.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What’ll I be?” Lottie asked everybody, and she sat there smiling,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,waiting for them to decide for her. It had to be an easy one.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Be a donkey, Lottie.” It was Kezia’s suggestion. “Hee-haw! You can’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,forget that.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Hee-haw!” said Lottie solemnly. “When do I have to say it?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ll explain, I’ll explain,” said the bull. It was he who had the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cards. He waved them round his head. “All be quiet! All listen!” And he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"waited for them. “Look here, Lottie.” He turned up a card. “It’s got",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"two spots on it—see? Now, if you put that card in the middle and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"somebody else has one with two spots as well, you say ‘Hee-haw,’ and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the card’s yours.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Mine?” Lottie was round-eyed. “To keep?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, silly. Just for the game, see? Just while we’re playing.” The bull",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was very cross with her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Lottie, you _are_ a little silly,” said the proud rooster.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lottie looked at both of them. Then she hung her head; her lip,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"quivered. “I don’t want to play,” she whispered. The others glanced at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,one another like conspirators. All of them knew what that meant. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would go away and be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thrown over her head, in a corner, or against a wall, or even behind a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chair.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, you _do_, Lottie. It’s quite easy,” said Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Isabel, repentant, said exactly like a grown-up, “Watch _me_,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Lottie, and you’ll soon learn.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Cheer up, Lot,” said Pip. “There, I know what I’ll do. I’ll give you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the first one. It’s mine, really, but I’ll give it to you. Here you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,are.” And he slammed the card down in front of Lottie.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lottie revived at that. But now she was in another difficulty. “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"haven’t got a hanky,” she said; “I want one badly, too.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, Lottie, you can use mine.” Rags dipped into his sailor blouse",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and brought up a very wet-looking one, knotted together. “Be very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"careful,” he warned her. “Only use that corner. Don’t undo it. I’ve got",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a little starfish inside I’m going to try and tame.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, come on, you girls,” said the bull. “And mind—you’re not to look",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at your cards. You’ve got to keep your hands under the table till I say,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,‘Go.’”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Smack went the cards round the table. They tried with all their might,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to see, but Pip was too quick for them. It was very exciting, sitting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there in the washhouse; it was all they could do not to burst into a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little chorus of animals before Pip had finished dealing.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Now, Lottie, you begin.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Timidly Lottie stretched out a hand, took the top card off her pack,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had a good look at it—it was plain she was counting the spots—and put,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, Lottie, you can’t do that. You mustn’t look first. You must turn",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it the other way over.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But then everybody will see it the same time as me,” said Lottie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The game proceeded. Mooe-ooo-er! The bull was terrible. He charged over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the table and seemed to eat the cards up.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Bss-ss! said the bee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Cock-a-doodle-do! Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,elbows like wings.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Baa! Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,one they called the King of Spain. She had hardly any cards left.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Why don’t you call out, Lottie?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ve forgotten what I am,” said the donkey woefully.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, change! Be a dog instead! Bow-wow!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh yes. That’s _much_ easier.” Lottie smiled again. But when she and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose. The others made signs to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Lottie and pointed. Lottie turned very red; she looked bewildered, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at last she said, “Hee-haw! Ke-zia.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Ss! Wait a minute!” They were in the very thick of it when the bull,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stopped them, holding up his hand. “What’s that? What’s that noise?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What noise? What do you mean?” asked the rooster.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Ss! Shut up! Listen!” They were mouse-still. “I thought I heard a—a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sort of knocking,” said the bull.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What was it like?” asked the sheep faintly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,No answer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The bee gave a shudder. “Whatever did we shut the door for?” she said,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"softly. Oh, why, why had they shut the door?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"While they were playing, the day had faded; the gorgeous sunset had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"blazed and died. And now the quick dark came racing over the sea, over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the sand-hills, up the paddock. You were frightened to look in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"corners of the washhouse, and yet you had to look with all your might.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp. The blinds were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,being pulled down; the kitchen fire leapt in the tins on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mantelpiece.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It would be awful now,” said the bull, “if a spider was to fall from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the ceiling on to the table, wouldn’t it?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Spiders don’t fall from ceilings.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, they do. Our Min told us she’d seen a spider as big as a saucer,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with long hairs on it like a gooseberry.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Quickly all the little heads were jerked up; all the little bodies drew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"together, pressed together.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Why doesn’t somebody come and call us?” cried the rooster.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, those grown-ups, laughing and snug, sitting in the lamp-light,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"drinking out of cups! They’d forgotten about them. No, not really",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,forgotten. That was what their smile meant. They had decided to leave,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,them there all by themselves.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Suddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the forms, all of them screamed too. “A face—a face looking!” shrieked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lottie.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It was true, it was real. Pressed against the window was a pale face,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"black eyes, a black beard.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Grandma! Mother! Somebody!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But they had not got to the door, tumbling over one another, before it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,opened for Uncle Jonathan. He had come to take the little boys home.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,X,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He had meant to be there before, but in the front garden he had come",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"pink or give a top-heavy carnation something to lean against, or to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"take a deep breath of something, and then walking on again, with her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little air of remoteness. Over her white frock she wore a yellow,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pink-fringed shawl from the Chinaman’s shop.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hallo, Jonathan!” called Linda. And Jonathan whipped off his shabby",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,Linda’s hand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Greeting, my Fair One! Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom!” boomed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Linda dropped into Beryl’s hammock under the manuka-tree, and Jonathan",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stretched himself on the grass beside her, pulled a long stalk and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,began chewing it. They knew each other well. The voices of children,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cried from the other gardens. A fisherman’s light cart shook along the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sandy road, and from far away they heard a dog barking; it was muffled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as though the dog had its head in a sack. If you listened you could,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,just hear the soft swish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The sun was sinking.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister? Would ye have me weep?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,anything.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Does one? Hum!” The “Hum” was so deep it seemed to boom from,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,Jonathan? He had no ambition; she supposed that was it. And yet one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"felt he was gifted, exceptional. He was passionately fond of music;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,described and dilated on the new thing; but a moment later it had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fallen in and there was nothing but ashes, and Jonathan went about with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a look like hunger in his black eyes. At these times he exaggerated his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"absurd manner of speaking, and he sang in church—he was the leader of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the choir—with such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,put on an unholy splendour.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It seems to me just as imbecile, just as infernal, to have to go to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the office on Monday,” said Jonathan, “as it always has done and always",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,will do. To spend all the best years of one’s life sitting on a stool,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"from nine to five, scratching in somebody’s ledger! It’s a queer use to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"make of one’s... one and only life, isn’t it? Or do I fondly dream?” He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda. “Tell me, what is the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,difference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner. The only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,difference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobody’s ever,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,going to let me out. That’s a more intolerable situation than the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other. For if I’d been—pushed in, against my will—kicking, even—once",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the door was locked, or at any rate in five years or so, I might have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,accepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of flies,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,or counting the warder’s steps along the passage with particular,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"attention to variations of tread and so on. But as it is, I’m like an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,insect that’s flown into a room of its own accord. I dash against the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"walls, dash against the windows, flop against the ceiling, do",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everything on God’s earth, in fact, except fly out again. And all the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"while I’m thinking, like that moth, or that butterfly, or whatever it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"is, ‘The shortness of life! The shortness of life!’ I’ve only one night",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"or one day, and there’s this vast dangerous garden, waiting out there,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"undiscovered, unexplored.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, if you feel like that, why—” began Linda quickly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_Ah!_” cried Jonathan. And that “ah!” was somehow almost exultant.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There you have me. Why? Why indeed? There’s the maddening, mysterious",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,question. Why don’t I fly out again? There’s the window or the door or,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,whatever it was I came in by. It’s not hopelessly shut—is it? Why don’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I find it and be off? Answer me that, little sister.” But he gave her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,no time to answer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I’m exactly like that insect again. For some reason”—Jonathan paused,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"between the words—“it’s not allowed, it’s forbidden, it’s against the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"insect law, to stop banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for an instant. Why don’t I leave the office? Why don’t I seriously,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"consider, this moment, for instance, what it is that prevents me",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leaving? It’s not as though I’m tremendously tied. I’ve two boys to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"provide for, but, after all, they’re boys. I could cut off to sea, or",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"get a job up-country, or—” Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"changed voice, as if he were confiding a secret, “Weak... weak. No",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stamina. No anchor. No guiding principle, let us call it.” But then the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dark velvety voice rolled out:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     Would ye hear the story,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     How it unfolds itself. . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and they were silent.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The sun had set. In the western sky there were great masses of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,crushed-up rose-coloured clouds. Broad beams of light shone through the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,clouds and beyond them as if they would cover the whole sky. Overhead,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the blue faded; it turned a pale gold, and the bush outlined against it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gleamed dark and brilliant like metal. Sometimes when those beams of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,light show in the sky they are very awful. They remind you that up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there sits Jehovah, the jealous God, the Almighty, Whose eye is upon",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you, ever watchful, never weary. You remember that at His coming the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"whole earth will shake into one ruined graveyard; the cold, bright",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"angels will drive you this way and that, and there will be no time to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,explain what could be explained so simply.... But to-night it seemed to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Linda there was something infinitely joyful and loving in those silver,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beams. And now no sound came from the sea. It breathed softly as if it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"would draw that tender, joyful beauty into its own bosom.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s all wrong, it’s all wrong,” came the shadowy voice of Jonathan.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s not the scene, it’s not the setting for... three stools, three",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"desks, three inkpots and a wire blind.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Linda knew that he would never change, but she said, “Is it too late,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,even now?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m old—I’m old,” intoned Jonathan. He bent towards her, he passed his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hand over his head. “Look!” His black hair was speckled all over with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"silver, like the breast plumage of a black fowl.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Linda was surprised. She had no idea that he was grey. And yet, as he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stood up beside her and sighed and stretched, she saw him, for the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"first time, not resolute, not gallant, not careless, but touched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"already with age. He looked very tall on the darkening grass, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thought crossed her mind, “He is like a weed.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Jonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine,” he murmured. “I must go",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,seek those heirs to my fame and fortune....” He was gone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,XI,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Light shone in the windows of the bungalow. Two square patches of gold,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fell upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds. Florrie, the cat, came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out on to the veranda, and sat on the top step, her white paws close",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"together, her tail curled round. She looked content, as though she had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,been waiting for this moment all day.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thank goodness, it’s getting late,” said Florrie. “Thank goodness, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,long day is over.” Her greengage eyes opened.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Presently there sounded the rumble of the coach, the crack of Kelly’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,whip. It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"town, talking loudly together. It stopped at the Burnells’ gate.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Stanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. “Is that you,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,darling?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, Stanley.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. She was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"enfolded in that familiar, eager, strong embrace.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Forgive me, darling, forgive me,” stammered Stanley, and he put his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hand under her chin and lifted her face to him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Forgive you?” smiled Linda. “But whatever for?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good God! You can’t have forgotten,” cried Stanley Burnell. “I’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought of nothing else all day. I’ve had the hell of a day. I made up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"my mind to dash out and telegraph, and then I thought the wire mightn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"reach you before I did. I’ve been in tortures, Linda.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, Stanley,” said Linda, “what must I forgive you for?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Linda!”—Stanley was very hurt—“didn’t you realize—you must have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,realized—I went away without saying good-bye to you this morning? I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"can’t imagine how I can have done such a thing. My confounded temper,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of course. But—well”—and he sighed and took her in his arms again—“I’ve,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,suffered for it enough to-day.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What’s that you’ve got in your hand?” asked Linda. “New gloves? Let me,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,see.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, just a cheap pair of wash-leather ones,” said Stanley humbly. “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"noticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning, so, as I was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"passing the shop, I dashed in and got myself a pair. What are you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smiling at? You don’t think it was wrong of me, do you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“On the _con_-trary, darling,” said Linda, “I think it was most",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sensible.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She pulled one of the large, pale gloves on her own fingers and looked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at her hand, turning it this way and that. She was still smiling.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Stanley wanted to say, “I was thinking of you the whole time I bought",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them.” It was true, but for some reason he couldn’t say it. “Let’s go",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,XII,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Why does one feel so different at night? Why is it so exciting to be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,awake when everybody else is asleep? Late—it is very late! And yet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"every moment you feel more and more wakeful, as though you were slowly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"almost with every breath, waking up into a new, wonderful, far more",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thrilling and exciting world than the daylight one. And what is this,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"queer sensation that you’re a conspirator? Lightly, stealthily you move",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about your room. You take something off the dressing-table and put it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"down again without a sound. And everything, even the bed-post, knows",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you, responds, shares your secret....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,You’re not very fond of your room by day. You never think about it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"You’re in and out, the door opens and slams, the cupboard creaks. You",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A dive down to the glass, two pins in your hair, powder your nose and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,off again. But now—it’s suddenly dear to you. It’s a darling little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"funny room. It’s yours. Oh, what a joy it is to own things! Mine—my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,own!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“My very own for ever?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Yes.” Their lips met.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No, of course, that had nothing to do with it. That was all nonsense",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and rubbish. But, in spite of herself, Beryl saw so plainly two people",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,standing in the middle of her room. Her arms were round his neck; he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"held her. And now he whispered, “My beauty, my little beauty!” She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"jumped off her bed, ran over to the window and kneeled on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"window-seat, with her elbows on the sill. But the beautiful night, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"garden, every bush, every leaf, even the white palings, even the stars,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were conspirators too. So bright was the moon that the flowers were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bright as by day; the shadow of the nasturtiums, exquisite lily-like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"leaves and wide-open flowers, lay across the silvery veranda. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"manuka-tree, bent by the southerly winds, was like a bird on one leg",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stretching out a wing.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But when Beryl looked at the bush, it seemed to her the bush was sad.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We are dumb trees, reaching up in the night, imploring we know not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what,” said the sorrowful bush.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It is true when you are by yourself and you think about life, it is",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,always sad. All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you, and it’s as though, in the silence, somebody called your name, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you heard your name for the first time. “Beryl!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, I’m here. I’m Beryl. Who wants me?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It is lonely living by oneself. Of course, there are relations,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"Oh why, oh why doesn’t “he” come soon?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Beryl dismissed it. She couldn’t be left. Other people, perhaps,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“Do you remember Beryl Fairfield?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"that I saw her. She was standing on the beach in a blue”—no,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“She’s as lovely as ever, more so if anything.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Beryl smiled, bit her lip, and gazed over the garden. As she gazed, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw somebody, a man, leave the road, step along the paddock beside",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"Who was it? Who could it be? It couldn’t be a burglar, certainly not a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"burglar, for he was smoking and he strolled lightly. Beryl’s heart",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"leapt; it seemed to turn right over, and then to stop. She recognized",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Won’t you come for a little walk?” it drawled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh,” said the voice lightly, and a whiff of sweet smoke reached her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,not a soul about.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Beryl shook her head. But already something stirred in her, something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"The voice said, “Frightened?” It mocked, “Poor little girl!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not in the least,” said she. As she spoke that weak thing within her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"seemed to uncoil, to grow suddenly tremendously strong; she longed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,go!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And just as if this was quite understood by the other, the voice said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Beryl stepped over her low window, crossed the veranda, ran down the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She was; now she was here she was terrified, and it seemed to her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not in the least,” she said lightly. “Why should I be?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,His smile was something she’d never seen before. Was he drunk? That,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,doing? How had she got here? the stern garden asked her as the gate,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,Nobody answered him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A cloud, small, serene, floated across the moon. In that moment of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"darkness the sea sounded deep, troubled. Then the cloud sailed away,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and the sound of the sea was a vague murmur, as though it waked out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a dark dream. All was still.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,And after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,are the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flowers that everybody is certain of knowing. Hundreds, yes, literally",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as though they had been visited by archangels.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Breakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Where do you want the marquee put, mother?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,everything to you children this year. Forget I am your mother. Treat me,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as an honoured guest.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men. She had washed her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hair before breakfast, and she sat drinking her coffee in a green",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"turban, with a dark wet curl stamped on each cheek. Jose, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"butterfly, always came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“You’ll have to go, Laura; you’re the artistic one.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Away Laura flew, still holding her piece of bread-and-butter. It’s so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"delicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors, and besides, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,loved having to arrange things; she always felt she could do it so much,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,better than anybody else.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Four men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"path. They carried staves covered with rolls of canvas, and they had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,big tool-bags slung on their backs. They looked impressive. Laura,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wished now that she had not got the bread-and-butter, but there was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nowhere to put it, and she couldn’t possibly throw it away. She blushed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and tried to look severe and even a little bit short-sighted as she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,came up to them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good morning,” she said, copying her mother’s voice. But that sounded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girl, “Oh—er—have you come—is it about the marquee?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s right, miss,” said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smiled down at her. “That’s about it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"His smile was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered. What nice eyes",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he had, small, but such a dark blue! And now she looked at the others,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"they were smiling too. “Cheer up, we won’t bite,” their smile seemed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say. How very nice workmen were! And what a beautiful morning! She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mustn’t mention the morning; she must be business-like. The marquee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, what about the lily-lawn? Would that do?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And she pointed to the lily-lawn with the hand that didn’t hold the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bread-and-butter. They turned, they stared in the direction. A little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fat chap thrust out his under-lip, and the tall fellow frowned.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t fancy it,” said he. “Not conspicuous enough. You see, with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thing like a marquee,” and he turned to Laura in his easy way, “you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"want to put it somewhere where it’ll give you a bang slap in the eye,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,if you follow me.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura’s upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,respectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye. But,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she did quite follow him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A corner of the tennis-court,” she suggested. “But the band’s going to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be in one corner.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“H’m, going to have a band, are you?” said another of the workmen. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was pale. He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tennis-court. What was he thinking?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Only a very small band,” said Laura gently. Perhaps he wouldn’t mind",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so much if the band was quite small. But the tall fellow interrupted.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Look here, miss, that’s the place. Against those trees. Over there.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,That’ll do fine.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Against the karakas. Then the karaka-trees would be hidden. And they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were so lovely, with their broad, gleaming leaves, and their clusters",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of yellow fruit. They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"island, proud, solitary, lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a kind of silent splendour. Must they be hidden by a marquee?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,They must. Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for the place. Only the tall fellow was left. He bent down, pinched a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sprig of lavender, put his thumb and forefinger to his nose and snuffed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,up the smell. When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,karakas in her wonder at him caring for things like that—caring for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smell of lavender. How many men that she knew would have done such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thing? Oh, how extraordinarily nice workmen were, she thought. Why",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,couldn’t she have workmen for her friends rather than the silly boys,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she danced with and who came to Sunday night supper? She would get on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,much better with men like these.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It’s all the fault, she decided, as the tall fellow drew something on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the back of an envelope, something that was to be looped up or left to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hang, of these absurd class distinctions. Well, for her part, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"didn’t feel them. Not a bit, not an atom.... And now there came the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chock-chock of wooden hammers. Some one whistled, some one sang out,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Are you right there, matey?” “Matey!” The friendliness of it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the—the—Just to prove how happy she was, just to show the tall fellow",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"how at home she felt, and how she despised stupid conventions, Laura",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,took a big bite of her bread-and-butter as she stared at the little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drawing. She felt just like a work-girl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Laura, Laura, where are you? Telephone, Laura!” a voice cried from the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,house.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Coming!” Away she skimmed, over the lawn, up the path, up the steps,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"across the veranda, and into the porch. In the hall her father and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say, Laura,” said Laurie very fast, “you might just give a squiz at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,my coat before this afternoon. See if it wants pressing.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I will,” said she. Suddenly she couldn’t stop herself. She ran at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laurie and gave him a small, quick squeeze. “Oh, I do love parties,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t you?” gasped Laura.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ra-ther,” said Laurie’s warm, boyish voice, and he squeezed his sister",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"too, and gave her a gentle push. “Dash off to the telephone, old girl.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The telephone. “Yes, yes; oh yes. Kitty? Good morning, dear. Come to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lunch? Do, dear. Delighted of course. It will only be a very scratch",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meal—just the sandwich crusts and broken meringue-shells and what’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"left over. Yes, isn’t it a perfect morning? Your white? Oh, I certainly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,should. One moment—hold the line. Mother’s calling.” And Laura sat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back. “What, mother? Can’t hear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Mrs. Sheridan’s voice floated down the stairs. “Tell her to wear that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sweet hat she had on last Sunday.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Mother says you’re to wear that _sweet_ hat you had on last Sunday.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Good. One o’clock. Bye-bye.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura put back the receiver, flung her arms over her head, took a deep",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"breath, stretched and let them fall. “Huh,” she sighed, and the moment",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after the sigh she sat up quickly. She was still, listening. All the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"doors in the house seemed to be open. The house was alive with soft,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quick steps and running voices. The green baize door that led to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kitchen regions swung open and shut with a muffled thud. And now there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"came a long, chuckling absurd sound. It was the heavy piano being moved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on its stiff castors. But the air! If you stopped to notice, was the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"air always like this? Little faint winds were playing chase, in at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tops of the windows, out at the doors. And there were two tiny spots of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sun, one on the inkpot, one on a silver photograph frame, playing too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Darling little spots. Especially the one on the inkpot lid. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quite warm. A warm little silver star. She could have kissed it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The front door bell pealed, and there sounded the rustle of Sadie’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"print skirt on the stairs. A man’s voice murmured; Sadie answered,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"careless, “I’m sure I don’t know. Wait. I’ll ask Mrs Sheridan.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What is it, Sadie?” Laura came into the hall.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s the florist, Miss Laura.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It was, indeed. There, just inside the door, stood a wide, shallow tray",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,full of pots of pink lilies. No other kind. Nothing but lilies—canna,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lilies, big pink flowers, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,alive on bright crimson stems.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“O-oh, Sadie!” said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"they were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s some mistake,” she said faintly. “Nobody ever ordered so many.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Sadie, go and find mother.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s quite right,” she said calmly. “Yes, I ordered them. Aren’t they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lovely?” She pressed Laura’s arm. “I was passing the shop yesterday,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and I saw them in the window. And I suddenly thought for once in my,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,life I shall have enough canna lilies. The garden-party will be a good,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,excuse.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But I thought you said you didn’t mean to interfere,” said Laura.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Sadie had gone. The florist’s man was still outside at his van. She put,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her arm round her mother’s neck and gently, very gently, she bit her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mother’s ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My darling child, you wouldn’t like a logical mother, would you? Don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,do that. Here’s the man.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He carried more lilies still, another whole tray.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Bank them up, just inside the door, on both sides of the porch,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"please,” said Mrs. Sheridan. “Don’t you agree, Laura?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Oh, I _do_, mother.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"out of the room except the chairs, don’t you think?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“Quite.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Hans, move these tables into the smoking-room, and bring a sweeper to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"take these marks off the carpet and—one moment, Hans—” Jose loved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"giving orders to the servants, and they loved obeying her. She always",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,made them feel they were taking part in some drama. “Tell mother and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Miss Laura to come here at once.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Very good, Miss Jose.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"idea made one shudder. All the same, two minutes later Jose and Laura",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were licking their fingers with that absorbed inward look that only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,comes from whipped cream.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Let’s go into the garden, out by the back way,” suggested Laura. “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,want to see how the men are getting on with the marquee. They’re such,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,awfully nice men.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But the back door was blocked by cook, Sadie, Godber’s man and Hans.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Something had happened.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tuk-tuk-tuk,” clucked cook like an agitated hen. Sadie had her hand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,clapped to her cheek as though she had toothache. Hans’s face was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,screwed up in the effort to understand. Only Godber’s man seemed to be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,enjoying himself; it was his story.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What’s the matter? What’s happened?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There’s been a horrible accident,” said Cook. “A man killed.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“A man killed! Where? How? When?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Godber’s man wasn’t going to have his story snatched from under his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,very nose.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Know those little cottages just below here, miss?” Know them? Of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"course, she knew them. “Well, there’s a young chap living there, name",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of Scott, a carter. His horse shied at a traction-engine, corner of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hawke Street this morning, and he was thrown out on the back of his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,head. Killed.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Dead!” Laura stared at Godber’s man.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Dead when they picked him up,” said Godber’s man with relish. “They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were taking the body home as I come up here.” And he said to the cook,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“He’s left a wife and five little ones.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Jose, come here.” Laura caught hold of her sister’s sleeve and dragged",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her through the kitchen to the other side of the green baize door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There she paused and leaned against it. “Jose!” she said, horrified,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“however are we going to stop everything?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Stop everything, Laura!” cried Jose in astonishment. “What do you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mean?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Stop the garden-party, of course.” Why did Jose pretend?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Jose was still more amazed. “Stop the garden-party? My dear Laura,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t be so absurd. Of course we can’t do anything of the kind. Nobody,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expects us to. Don’t be so extravagant.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But we can’t possibly have a garden-party with a man dead just outside,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the front gate.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"That really was extravagant, for the little cottages were in a lane to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,themselves at the very bottom of a steep rise that led up to the house.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A broad road ran between. True, they were far too near. They were the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"greatest possible eyesore, and they had no right to be in that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,neighbourhood at all. They were little mean dwellings painted a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chocolate brown. In the garden patches there was nothing but cabbage,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stalks, sick hens and tomato cans. The very smoke coming out of their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chimneys was poverty-stricken. Little rags and shreds of smoke, so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,unlike the great silvery plumes that uncurled from the Sheridans’,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chimneys. Washerwomen lived in the lane and sweeps and a cobbler, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,man whose house-front was studded all over with minute bird-cages.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Children swarmed. When the Sheridans were little they were forbidden to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,set foot there because of the revolting language and of what they might,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"catch. But since they were grown up, Laura and Laurie on their prowls",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sometimes walked through. It was disgusting and sordid. They came out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with a shudder. But still one must go everywhere; one must see,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,everything. So through they went.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And just think of what the band would sound like to that poor woman,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,said Laura.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Laura!” Jose began to be seriously annoyed. “If you’re going to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stop a band playing every time some one has an accident, you’ll lead a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,very strenuous life. I’m every bit as sorry about it as you. I feel,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,just as sympathetic.” Her eyes hardened. She looked at her sister just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as she used to when they were little and fighting together. “You won’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bring a drunken workman back to life by being sentimental,” she said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,softly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Drunk! Who said he was drunk?” Laura turned furiously on Jose. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"said, just as they had used to say on those occasions, “I’m going",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,straight up to tell mother.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do, dear,” cooed Jose.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mother, can I come into your room?” Laura turned the big glass",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,door-knob.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Of course, child. Why, what’s the matter? What’s given you such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,colour?” And Mrs. Sheridan turned round from her dressing-table. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was trying on a new hat.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mother, a man’s been killed,” began Laura.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_Not_ in the garden?” interrupted her mother.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, no!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, what a fright you gave me!” Mrs. Sheridan sighed with relief, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,took off the big hat and held it on her knees.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But listen, mother,” said Laura. Breathless, half-choking, she told",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the dreadful story. “Of course, we can’t have our party, can we?” she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pleaded. “The band and everybody arriving. They’d hear us, mother;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they’re nearly neighbours!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,To Laura’s astonishment her mother behaved just like Jose; it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,harder to bear because she seemed amused. She refused to take Laura,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,seriously.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, my dear child, use your common sense. It’s only by accident we’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,heard of it. If some one had died there normally—and I can’t understand,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,how they keep alive in those poky little holes—we should still be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"having our party, shouldn’t we?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura had to say “yes” to that, but she felt it was all wrong. She sat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down on her mother’s sofa and pinched the cushion frill.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mother, isn’t it terribly heartless of us?” she asked.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Darling!” Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the hat.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Before Laura could stop her she had popped it on. “My child!” said her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mother, “the hat is yours. It’s made for you. It’s much too young for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,me. I have never seen you look such a picture. Look at yourself!” And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she held up her hand-mirror.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, mother,” Laura began again. She couldn’t look at herself; she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,turned aside.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,This time Mrs. Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You are being very absurd, Laura,” she said coldly. “People like that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t expect sacrifices from us. And it’s not very sympathetic to spoil,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,everybody’s enjoyment as you’re doing now.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t understand,” said Laura, and she walked quickly out of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"room into her own bedroom. There, quite by chance, the first thing she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw was this charming girl in the mirror, in her black hat trimmed with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gold daisies, and a long black velvet ribbon. Never had she imagined",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she could look like that. Is mother right? she thought. And now she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hoped her mother was right. Am I being extravagant? Perhaps it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extravagant. Just for a moment she had another glimpse of that poor,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"woman and those little children, and the body being carried into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"house. But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"newspaper. I’ll remember it again after the party’s over, she decided.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And somehow that seemed quite the best plan....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lunch was over by half-past one. By half-past two they were all ready,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for the fray. The green-coated band had arrived and was established in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a corner of the tennis-court.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My dear!” trilled Kitty Maitland, “aren’t they too like frogs for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,words? You ought to have arranged them round the pond with the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,conductor in the middle on a leaf.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laurie arrived and hailed them on his way to dress. At the sight of him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura remembered the accident again. She wanted to tell him. If Laurie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"agreed with the others, then it was bound to be all right. And she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,followed him into the hall.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Laurie!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hallo!” He was half-way upstairs, but when he turned round and saw",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura he suddenly puffed out his cheeks and goggled his eyes at her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My word, Laura! You do look stunning,” said Laurie. “What an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,absolutely topping hat!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura said faintly “Is it?” and smiled up at Laurie, and didn’t tell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him after all.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Soon after that people began coming in streams. The band struck up; the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hired waiters ran from the house to the marquee. Wherever you looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there were couples strolling, bending to the flowers, greeting, moving",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on over the lawn. They were like bright birds that had alighted in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Sheridans’ garden for this one afternoon, on their way to—where? Ah,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what happiness it is to be with people who all are happy, to press",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hands, press cheeks, smile into eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Darling Laura, how well you look!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What a becoming hat, child!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Laura, you look quite Spanish. I’ve never seen you look so striking.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Laura, glowing, answered softly, “Have you had tea? Won’t you have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,an ice? The passion-fruit ices really are rather special.” She ran to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her father and begged him. “Daddy darling, can’t the band have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,something to drink?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And the perfect afternoon slowly ripened, slowly faded, slowly its",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,petals closed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Never a more delightful garden-party....” “The greatest success....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Quite the most....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura helped her mother with the good-byes. They stood side by side in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the porch till it was all over.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“All over, all over, thank heaven,” said Mrs. Sheridan. “Round up the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"others, Laura. Let’s go and have some fresh coffee. I’m exhausted. Yes,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it’s been very successful. But oh, these parties, these parties! Why",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,will you children insist on giving parties!” And they all of them sat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down in the deserted marquee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Have a sandwich, daddy dear. I wrote the flag.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Thanks.” Mr. Sheridan took a bite and the sandwich was gone. He took,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,another. “I suppose you didn’t hear of a beastly accident that happened,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to-day?” he said.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My dear,” said Mrs. Sheridan, holding up her hand, “we did. It nearly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ruined the party. Laura insisted we should put it off.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, mother!” Laura didn’t want to be teased about it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It was a horrible affair all the same,” said Mr. Sheridan. “The chap",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was married too. Lived just below in the lane, and leaves a wife and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"half a dozen kiddies, so they say.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,An awkward little silence fell. Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her cup.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Really, it was very tactless of father....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Suddenly she looked up. There on the table were all those sandwiches,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cakes, puffs, all uneaten, all going to be wasted. She had one of her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brilliant ideas.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I know,” she said. “Let’s make up a basket. Let’s send that poor",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"creature some of this perfectly good food. At any rate, it will be the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,greatest treat for the children. Don’t you agree? And she’s sure to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have neighbours calling in and so on. What a point to have it all ready,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,prepared. Laura!” She jumped up. “Get me the big basket out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stairs cupboard.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, mother, do you really think it’s a good idea?” said Laura.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Again, how curious, she seemed to be different from them all. To take",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,scraps from their party. Would the poor woman really like that?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Of course! What’s the matter with you to-day? An hour or two ago you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were insisting on us being sympathetic, and now—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh well! Laura ran for the basket. It was filled, it was heaped by her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mother.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Take it yourself, darling,” said she. “Run down just as you are. No,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wait, take the arum lilies too. People of that class are so impressed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,by arum lilies.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“The stems will ruin her lace frock,” said practical Jose.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"So they would. Just in time. “Only the basket, then. And, Laura!”—her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mother followed her out of the marquee—“don’t on any account—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What mother?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No, better not put such ideas into the child’s head! “Nothing! Run",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,along.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates. A big dog,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ran by like a shadow. The road gleamed white, and down below in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hollow the little cottages were in deep shade. How quiet it seemed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,after the afternoon. Here she was going down the hill to somewhere,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"where a man lay dead, and she couldn’t realize it. Why couldn’t she?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She stopped a minute. And it seemed to her that kisses, voices,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tinkling spoons, laughter, the smell of crushed grass were somehow",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,inside her. She had no room for anything else. How strange! She looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up at the pale sky, and all she thought was, “Yes, it was the most",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,successful party.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Now the broad road was crossed. The lane began, smoky and dark. Women",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in shawls and men’s tweed caps hurried by. Men hung over the palings;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the children played in the doorways. A low hum came from the mean,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little cottages. In some of them there was a flicker of light, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shadow, crab-like, moved across the window. Laura bent her head and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hurried on. She wished now she had put on a coat. How her frock shone!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And the big hat with the velvet streamer—if only it was another hat!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Were the people looking at her? They must be. It was a mistake to have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,come; she knew all along it was a mistake. Should she go back even now?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No, too late. This was the house. It must be. A dark knot of people",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stood outside. Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chair, watching. She had her feet on a newspaper. The voices stopped as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura drew near. The group parted. It was as though she was expected,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as though they had known she was coming here.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura was terribly nervous. Tossing the velvet ribbon over her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shoulder, she said to a woman standing by, “Is this Mrs. Scott’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"house?” and the woman, smiling queerly, said, “It is, my lass.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, to be away from this! She actually said, “Help me, God,” as she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,walked up the tiny path and knocked. To be away from those staring,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eyes, or to be covered up in anything, one of those women’s shawls",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even. I’ll just leave the basket and go, she decided. I shan’t even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wait for it to be emptied.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Then the door opened. A little woman in black showed in the gloom.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura said, “Are you Mrs. Scott?” But to her horror the woman answered,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Walk in please, miss,” and she was shut in the passage.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” said Laura, “I don’t want to come in. I only want to leave this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,basket. Mother sent—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Step this way, please, miss,” she said in an oily voice, and Laura",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,followed her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She found herself in a wretched little low kitchen, lighted by a smoky",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lamp. There was a woman sitting before the fire.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Em,” said the little creature who had let her in. “Em! It’s a young",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lady.” She turned to Laura. She said meaningly, “I’m ’er sister, miss.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"You’ll excuse ’er, won’t you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, but of course!” said Laura. “Please, please don’t disturb her. I—I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,only want to leave—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But at that moment the woman at the fire turned round. Her face, puffed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up, red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,seemed as though she couldn’t understand why Laura was there. What did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it mean? Why was this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What was it all about? And the poor face puckered up again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“All right, my dear,” said the other. “I’ll thenk the young lady.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And again she began, “You’ll excuse her, miss, I’m sure,” and her face,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"swollen too, tried an oily smile.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura only wanted to get out, to get away. She was back in the passage.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The door opened. She walked straight through into the bedroom, where",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the dead man was lying.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’d like a look at ’im, wouldn’t you?” said Em’s sister, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"brushed past Laura over to the bed. “Don’t be afraid, my lass,”—and now",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her voice sounded fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the sheet—“’e",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"looks a picture. There’s nothing to show. Come along, my dear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura came.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There lay a young man, fast asleep—sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he was far, far away from them both. Oh, so remote, so peaceful. He was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dreaming. Never wake him up again. His head was sunk in the pillow, his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eyes were closed; they were blind under the closed eyelids. He was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,given up to his dream. What did garden-parties and baskets and lace,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,frocks matter to him? He was far from all those things. He was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wonderful, beautiful. While they were laughing and while the band was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"playing, this marvel had come to the lane. Happy... happy.... All is",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"well, said that sleeping face. This is just as it should be. I am",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,content.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But all the same you had to cry, and she couldn’t go out of the room",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,without saying something to him. Laura gave a loud childish sob.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Forgive my hat,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And this time she didn’t wait for Em’s sister. She found her way out of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the door, down the path, past all those dark people. At the corner of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the lane she met Laurie.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He stepped out of the shadow. “Is that you, Laura?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Yes.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Mother was getting anxious. Was it all right?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, quite. Oh, Laurie!” She took his arm, she pressed up against him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say, you’re not crying, are you?” asked her brother.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura shook her head. She was.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laurie put his arm round her shoulder. “Don’t cry,” he said in his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"warm, loving voice. “Was it awful?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” sobbed Laura. “It was simply marvellous. But Laurie—” She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stopped, she looked at her brother. “Isn’t life,” she stammered, “isn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,life—” But what life was she couldn’t explain. No matter. He quite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,understood.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,The week after was one of the busiest weeks of their lives. Even when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they went to bed it was only their bodies that lay down and rested;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"their minds went on, thinking things out, talking things over,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wondering, deciding, trying to remember where....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia lay like a statue, her hands by her sides, her feet just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"overlapping each other, the sheet up to her chin. She stared at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ceiling.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Do you think father would mind if we gave his top-hat to the porter?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“The porter?” snapped Josephine. “Why ever the porter? What a very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extraordinary idea!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Because,” said Constantia slowly, “he must often have to go to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,funerals. And I noticed at—at the cemetery that he only had a bowler.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She paused. “I thought then how very much he’d appreciate a top-hat. We,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ought to give him a present, too. He was always very nice to father.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But,” cried Josephine, flouncing on her pillow and staring across the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dark at Constantia, “father’s head!” And suddenly, for one awful",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"moment, she nearly giggled. Not, of course, that she felt in the least",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like giggling. It must have been habit. Years ago, when they had stayed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"awake at night talking, their beds had simply heaved. And now the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"porter’s head, disappearing, popped out, like a candle, under father’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hat.... The giggle mounted, mounted; she clenched her hands; she fought",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it down; she frowned fiercely at the dark and said “Remember” terribly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sternly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We can decide to-morrow,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia had noticed nothing; she sighed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Do you think we ought to have our dressing-gowns dyed as well?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Black?” almost shrieked Josephine.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, what else?” said Constantia. “I was thinking—it doesn’t seem",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"quite sincere, in a way, to wear black out of doors and when we’re",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fully dressed, and then when we’re at home—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But nobody sees us,” said Josephine. She gave the bedclothes such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"twitch that both her feet became uncovered, and she had to creep up the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pillows to get them well under again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Kate does,” said Constantia. “And the postman very well might.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine thought of her dark-red slippers, which matched her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dressing-gown, and of Constantia’s favourite indefinite green ones",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,which went with hers. Black! Two black dressing-gowns and two pairs of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“I don’t think it’s absolutely necessary,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,letters have we had up till now?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Twenty-three.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine had replied to them all, and twenty-three times when she came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to “We miss our dear father so much” she had broken down and had to use,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her handkerchief, and on some of them even to soak up a very light-blue",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tear with an edge of blotting-paper. Strange! She couldn’t have put it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on—but twenty-three times. Even now, though, when she said over to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"herself sadly “We miss our dear father _so_ much,” she could have cried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,if she’d wanted to.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Have you got enough stamps?” came from Constantia.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, how can I tell?” said Josephine crossly. “What’s the good of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,asking me that now?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I was just wondering,” said Constantia mildly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Silence again. There came a little rustle, a scurry, a hop.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A mouse,” said Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It can’t be a mouse because there aren’t any crumbs,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But it doesn’t know there aren’t,” said Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A spasm of pity squeezed her heart. Poor little thing! She wished she’d,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,left a tiny piece of biscuit on the dressing-table. It was awful to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,think of it not finding anything. What would it do?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I can’t think how they manage to live at all,” she said slowly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Who?” demanded Josephine.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Constantia said more loudly than she meant to, “Mice.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine was furious. “Oh, what nonsense, Con!” she said. “What have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mice got to do with it? You’re asleep.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t think I am,” said Constantia. She shut her eyes to make sure.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She was.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine arched her spine, pulled up her knees, folded her arms so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,II,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Another thing which complicated matters was they had Nurse Andrews,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,staying on with them that week. It was their own fault; they had asked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her. It was Josephine’s idea. On the morning—well, on the last morning,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"when the doctor had gone, Josephine had said to Constantia, “Don’t you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,think it would be rather nice if we asked Nurse Andrews to stay on for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a week as our guest?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Very nice,” said Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I thought,” went on Josephine quickly, “I should just say this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"afternoon, after I’ve paid her, ‘My sister and I would be very pleased,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after all you’ve done for us, Nurse Andrews, if you would stay on for a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,week as our guest.’ I’d have to put that in about being our guest in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,case—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, but she could hardly expect to be paid!” cried Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“One never knows,” said Josephine sagely.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Nurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea. But it was a bother.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It meant they had to have regular sit-down meals at the proper times,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,whereas if they’d been alone they could just have asked Kate if she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wouldn’t have minded bringing them a tray wherever they were. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meal-times now that the strain was over were rather a trial.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Nurse Andrews was simply fearful about butter. Really they couldn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"help feeling that about butter, at least, she took advantage of their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kindness. And she had that maddening habit of asking for just an inch,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"more of bread to finish what she had on her plate, and then, at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"last mouthful, absent-mindedly—of course it wasn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,absent-mindedly—taking another helping. Josephine got very red when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"this happened, and she fastened her small, bead-like eyes on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tablecloth as if she saw a minute strange insect creeping through the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"web of it. But Constantia’s long, pale face lengthened and set, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gazed away—away—far over the desert, to where that line of camels",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,unwound like a thread of wool....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“When I was with Lady Tukes,” said Nurse Andrews, “she had such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dainty little contrayvance for the buttah. It was a silvah Cupid,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"balanced on the—on the bordah of a glass dish, holding a tayny fork.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And when you wanted some buttah you simply pressed his foot and he bent,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down and speared you a piece. It was quite a gayme.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine could hardly bear that. But “I think those things are very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extravagant” was all she said.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But whey?” asked Nurse Andrews, beaming through her eyeglasses. “No",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"one, surely, would take more buttah than one wanted—would one?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ring, Con,” cried Josephine. She couldn’t trust herself to reply.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And proud young Kate, the enchanted princess, came in to see what the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,old tabbies wanted now. She snatched away their plates of mock,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something or other and slapped down a white, terrified blancmange.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Jam, please, Kate,” said Josephine kindly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Kate knelt and burst open the sideboard, lifted the lid of the jam-pot,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw it was empty, put it on the table, and stalked off.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m afraid,” said Nurse Andrews a moment later, “there isn’t any.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, what a bother!” said Josephine. She bit her lip. “What had we",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,better do?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia looked dubious. “We can’t disturb Kate again,” she said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,softly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Nurse Andrews waited, smiling at them both. Her eyes wandered, spying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at everything behind her eyeglasses. Constantia in despair went back to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her camels. Josephine frowned heavily—concentrated. If it hadn’t been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for this idiotic woman she and Con would, of course, have eaten their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,blancmange without. Suddenly the idea came.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I know,” she said. “Marmalade. There’s some marmalade in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sideboard. Get it, Con.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I hope,” laughed Nurse Andrews—and her laugh was like a spoon tinkling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,against a medicine-glass—“I hope it’s not very bittah marmalayde.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,III,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But, after all, it was not long now, and then she’d be gone for good.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And there was no getting over the fact that she had been very kind to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"father. She had nursed him day and night at the end. Indeed, both",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia and Josephine felt privately she had rather overdone the not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leaving him at the very last. For when they had gone in to say good-bye,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Nurse Andrews had sat beside his bed the whole time, holding his wrist",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and pretending to look at her watch. It couldn’t have been necessary.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It was so tactless, too. Supposing father had wanted to say",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something—something private to them. Not that he had. Oh, far from it!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He lay there, purple, a dark, angry purple in the face, and never even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"looked at them when they came in. Then, as they were standing there,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wondering what to do, he had suddenly opened one eye. Oh, what a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"difference it would have made, what a difference to their memory of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"him, how much easier to tell people about it, if he had only opened",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,both! But no—one eye only. It glared at them a moment and then... went,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,IV,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It had made it very awkward for them when Mr. Farolles, of St. John’s,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,called the same afternoon.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“The end was quite peaceful, I trust?” were the first words he said as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he glided towards them through the dark drawing-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Quite,” said Josephine faintly. They both hung their heads. Both of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,them felt certain that eye wasn’t at all a peaceful eye.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Won’t you sit down?” said Josephine.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thank you, Miss Pinner,” said Mr. Farolles gratefully. He folded his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"coat-tails and began to lower himself into father’s arm-chair, but just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as he touched it he almost sprang up and slid into the next chair,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,instead.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He coughed. Josephine clasped her hands; Constantia looked vague.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I want you to feel, Miss Pinner,” said Mr. Farolles, “and you, Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia, that I’m trying to be helpful. I want to be helpful to you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"both, if you will let me. These are the times,” said Mr Farolles, very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"simply and earnestly, “when God means us to be helpful to one another.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thank you very much, Mr. Farolles,” said Josephine and Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not at all,” said Mr. Farolles gently. He drew his kid gloves through",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his fingers and leaned forward. “And if either of you would like a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little Communion, either or both of you, here _and_ now, you have only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to tell me. A little Communion is often very help—a great comfort,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,added tenderly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But the idea of a little Communion terrified them. What! In the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drawing-room by themselves—with no—no altar or anything! The piano,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"would be much too high, thought Constantia, and Mr. Farolles could not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,possibly lean over it with the chalice. And Kate would be sure to come,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bursting in and interrupt them, thought Josephine. And supposing the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bell rang in the middle? It might be somebody important—about their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mourning. Would they get up reverently and go out, or would they have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to wait... in torture?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Perhaps you will send round a note by your good Kate if you would care,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for it later,” said Mr. Farolles.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Oh yes, thank you very much!” they both said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"too expensive. At the same time, I should like—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A good one that will last,” thought dreamy Constantia, as if Josephine",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“One suitable to our father’s position.” She was very nervous.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ll run round to our good friend Mr. Knight,” said Mr. Farolles",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,soothingly. “I will ask him to come and see you. I am sure you will,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,find him very helpful indeed.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,V,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Well, at any rate, all that part of it was over, though neither of them",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could possibly believe that father was never coming back. Josephine had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"had a moment of absolute terror at the cemetery, while the coffin was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lowered, to think that she and Constantia had done this thing without",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,asking his permission. What would father say when he found out? For he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was bound to find out sooner or later. He always did. “Buried. You two,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girls had me _buried_!” She heard his stick thumping. Oh, what would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they say? What possible excuse could they make? It sounded such an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,appallingly heartless thing to do. Such a wicked advantage to take of a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,person because he happened to be helpless at the moment. The other,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,people seemed to treat it all as a matter of course. They were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,strangers; they couldn’t be expected to understand that father was the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very last person for such a thing to happen to. No, the entire blame",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for it all would fall on her and Constantia. And the expense, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thought, stepping into the tight-buttoned cab. When she had to show him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the bills. What would he say then?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She heard him absolutely roaring. “And do you expect me to pay for this,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gimcrack excursion of yours?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh,” groaned poor Josephine aloud, “we shouldn’t have done it, Con!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Constantia, pale as a lemon in all that blackness, said in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"frightened whisper, “Done what, Jug?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Let them bu-bury father like that,” said Josephine, breaking down and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"crying into her new, queer-smelling mourning handkerchief.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But what else could we have done?” asked Constantia wonderingly. “We,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"couldn’t have kept him, Jug—we couldn’t have kept him unburied. At any",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rate, not in a flat that size.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine blew her nose; the cab was dreadfully stuffy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t know,” she said forlornly. “It is all so dreadful. I feel we",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ought to have tried to, just for a time at least. To make perfectly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sure. One thing’s certain”—and her tears sprang out again—“father will,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,never forgive us for this—never!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,VI,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Father would never forgive them. That was what they felt more than ever,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"when, two mornings later, they went into his room to go through his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,things. They had discussed it quite calmly. It was even down on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine’s list of things to be done. “_Go through father’s things and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,settle about them._” But that was a very different matter from saying,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,after breakfast:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, are you ready, Con?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, Jug—when you are.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Then I think we’d better get it over.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was dark in the hall. It had been a rule for years never to disturb,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"father in the morning, whatever happened. And now they were going to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,open the door without knocking even.... Constantia’s eyes were enormous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at the idea; Josephine felt weak in the knees.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You—you go first,” she gasped, pushing Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Constantia said, as she always had said on those occasions, “No,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Jug, that’s not fair. You’re the eldest.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine was just going to say—what at other times she wouldn’t have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"owned to for the world—what she kept for her very last weapon, “But",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you’re the tallest,” when they noticed that the kitchen door was open,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and there stood Kate....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Very stiff,” said Josephine, grasping the doorhandle and doing her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,best to turn it. As if anything ever deceived Kate!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It couldn’t be helped. That girl was.... Then the door was shut behind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them, but—but they weren’t in father’s room at all. They might have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,suddenly walked through the wall by mistake into a different flat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,altogether. Was the door just behind them? They were too frightened to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,look. Josephine knew that if it was it was holding itself tight shut;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia felt that, like the doors in dreams, it hadn’t any handle at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all. It was the coldness which made it so awful. Or the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"whiteness—which? Everything was covered. The blinds were down, a cloth",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hung over the mirror, a sheet hid the bed; a huge fan of white paper",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,filled the fireplace. Constantia timidly put out her hand; she almost,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expected a snowflake to fall. Josephine felt a queer tingling in her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nose, as if her nose was freezing. Then a cab klop-klopped over the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cobbles below, and the quiet seemed to shake into little pieces.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I had better pull up a blind,” said Josephine bravely.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, it might be a good idea,” whispered Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They only gave the blind a touch, but it flew up and the cord flew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after, rolling round the blind-stick, and the little tassel tapped as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,if trying to get free. That was too much for Constantia.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t you think—don’t you think we might put it off for another day?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she whispered.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Why?” snapped Josephine, feeling, as usual, much better now that she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,knew for certain that Constantia was terrified. “It’s got to be done.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But I do wish you wouldn’t whisper, Con.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I didn’t know I was whispering,” whispered Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And why do you keep staring at the bed?” said Josephine, raising her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,voice almost defiantly. “There’s nothing _on_ the bed.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Jug, don’t say so!” said poor Connie. “At any rate, not so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,loudly.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine felt herself that she had gone too far. She took a wide,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"swerve over to the chest of drawers, put out her hand, but quickly drew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it back again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Connie!” she gasped, and she wheeled round and leaned with her back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,against the chest of drawers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Jug—what?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine could only glare. She had the most extraordinary feeling that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she had just escaped something simply awful. But how could she explain,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to Constantia that father was in the chest of drawers? He was in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"top drawer with his handkerchiefs and neckties, or in the next with his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shirts and pyjamas, or in the lowest of all with his suits. He was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"watching there, hidden away—just behind the door-handle—ready to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,spring.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She pulled a funny old-fashioned face at Constantia, just as she used",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to in the old days when she was going to cry.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I can’t open,” she nearly wailed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, don’t, Jug,” whispered Constantia earnestly. “It’s much better not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to. Don’t let’s open anything. At any rate, not for a long time.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But—but it seems so weak,” said Josephine, breaking down.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But why not be weak for once, Jug?” argued Constantia, whispering",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quite fiercely. “If it is weak.” And her pale stare flew from the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"locked writing-table—so safe—to the huge glittering wardrobe, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"began to breathe in a queer, panting away. “Why shouldn’t we be weak",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for once in our lives, Jug? It’s quite excusable. Let’s be weak—be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"weak, Jug. It’s much nicer to be weak than to be strong.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And then she did one of those amazingly bold things that she’d done,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"about twice before in their lives: she marched over to the wardrobe,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"turned the key, and took it out of the lock. Took it out of the lock",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and held it up to Josephine, showing Josephine by her extraordinary",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smile that she knew what she’d done—she’d risked deliberately father,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,being in there among his overcoats.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"If the huge wardrobe had lurched forward, had crashed down on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia, Josephine wouldn’t have been surprised. On the contrary,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she would have thought it the only suitable thing to happen. But,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nothing happened. Only the room seemed quieter than ever, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bigger flakes of cold air fell on Josephine’s shoulders and knees. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,began to shiver.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come, Jug,” said Constantia, still with that awful callous smile, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine followed just as she had that last time, when Constantia had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pushed Benny into the round pond.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,VII,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But the strain told on them when they were back in the dining-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They sat down, very shaky, and looked at each other.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I don’t feel I can settle to anything,” said Josephine, “until I’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had something. Do you think we could ask Kate for two cups of hot,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,water?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I really don’t see why we shouldn’t,” said Constantia carefully. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was quite normal again. “I won’t ring. I’ll go to the kitchen door and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ask her.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, do,” said Josephine, sinking down into a chair. “Tell her, just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"two cups, Con, nothing else—on a tray.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“She needn’t even put the jug on, need she?” said Constantia, as though",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kate might very well complain if the jug had been there.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh no, certainly not! The jug’s not at all necessary. She can pour it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"direct out of the kettle,” cried Josephine, feeling that would be a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,labour-saving indeed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims. Josephine curved her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,small red hands round the cup; Constantia sat up and blew on the wavy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"steam, making it flutter from one side to the other.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Speaking of Benny,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And though Benny hadn’t been mentioned Constantia immediately looked as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,though he had.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“He’ll expect us to send him something of father’s, of course. But it’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so difficult to know what to send to Ceylon.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You mean things get unstuck so on the voyage,” murmured Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, lost,” said Josephine sharply. “You know there’s no post. Only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,runners.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Both paused to watch a black man in white linen drawers running through,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the pale fields for dear life, with a large brown-paper parcel in his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hands. Josephine’s black man was tiny; he scurried along glistening,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like an ant. But there was something blind and tireless about,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia’s tall, thin fellow, which made him, she decided, a very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"unpleasant person indeed.... On the veranda, dressed all in white and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wearing a cork helmet, stood Benny. His right hand shook up and down,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as father’s did when he was impatient. And behind him, not in the least",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"interested, sat Hilda, the unknown sister-in-law. She swung in a cane",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rocker and flicked over the leaves of the _Tatler_.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I think his watch would be the most suitable present,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia looked up; she seemed surprised.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, would you trust a gold watch to a native?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But of course, I’d disguise it,” said Josephine. “No one would know it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was a watch.” She liked the idea of having to make a parcel such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,curious shape that no one could possibly guess what it was. She even,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought for a moment of hiding the watch in a narrow cardboard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"corset-box that she’d kept by her for a long time, waiting for it to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"come in for something. It was such beautiful, firm cardboard. But, no,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it wouldn’t be appropriate for this occasion. It had lettering on it:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,_Medium Women’s_ 28. _Extra Firm Busks._ It would be almost too much of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a surprise for Benny to open that and find father’s watch inside.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And of course it isn’t as though it would be going—ticking, I mean,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"said Constantia, who was still thinking of the native love of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"jewellery. “At least,” she added, “it would be very strange if after",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all that time it was.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,VIII,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine made no reply. She had flown off on one of her tangents. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had suddenly thought of Cyril. Wasn’t it more usual for the only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"grandson to have the watch? And then dear Cyril was so appreciative,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and a gold watch meant so much to a young man. Benny, in all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"probability, had quite got out of the habit of watches; men so seldom",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wore waistcoats in those hot climates. Whereas Cyril in London wore,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,them from year’s end to year’s end. And it would be so nice for her and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia, when he came to tea, to know it was there. “I see you’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"got on grandfather’s watch, Cyril.” It would be somehow so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,satisfactory.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Dear boy! What a blow his sweet, sympathetic little note had been! Of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,course they quite understood; but it was most unfortunate.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It would have been such a point, having him,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And he would have enjoyed it so,” said Constantia, not thinking what",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she was saying.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"However, as soon as he got back he was coming to tea with his aunties.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Cyril to tea was one of their rare treats.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Now, Cyril, you mustn’t be frightened of our cakes. Your Auntie Con",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and I bought them at Buszard’s this morning. We know what a man’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,appetite is. So don’t be ashamed of making a good tea.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine cut recklessly into the rich dark cake that stood for her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,winter gloves or the soling and heeling of Constantia’s only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,respectable shoes. But Cyril was most unmanlike in appetite.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say, Aunt Josephine, I simply can’t. I’ve only just had lunch, you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,know.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Cyril, that can’t be true! It’s after four,” cried Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia sat with her knife poised over the chocolate-roll.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It is, all the same,” said Cyril. “I had to meet a man at Victoria,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and he kept me hanging about till... there was only time to get lunch,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and to come on here. And he gave me—phew”—Cyril put his hand to his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"forehead—“a terrific blow-out,” he said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was disappointing—to-day of all days. But still he couldn’t be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expected to know.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But you’ll have a meringue, won’t you, Cyril?” said Aunt Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“These meringues were bought specially for you. Your dear father was so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fond of them. We were sure you are, too.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I _am_, Aunt Josephine,” cried Cyril ardently. “Do you mind if I take",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,half to begin with?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not at all, dear boy; but we mustn’t let you off with that.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Is your dear father still so fond of meringues?” asked Auntie Con,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gently. She winced faintly as she broke through the shell of hers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, I don’t quite know, Auntie Con,” said Cyril breezily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At that they both looked up.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t know?” almost snapped Josephine. “Don’t know a thing like that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"about your own father, Cyril?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Surely,” said Auntie Con softly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Cyril tried to laugh it off. “Oh, well,” he said, “it’s such a long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,time since—” He faltered. He stopped. Their faces were too much for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Even _so_,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And Auntie Con looked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Cyril put down his teacup. “Wait a bit,” he cried. “Wait a bit, Aunt",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine. What am I thinking of?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He looked up. They were beginning to brighten. Cyril slapped his knee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Of course,” he said, “it was meringues. How could I have forgotten?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Yes, Aunt Josephine, you’re perfectly right. Father’s most frightfully",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,keen on meringues.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,They didn’t only beam. Aunt Josephine went scarlet with pleasure;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Auntie Con gave a deep, deep sigh.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And now, Cyril, you must come and see father,” said Josephine. “He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,knows you were coming to-day.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Right,” said Cyril, very firmly and heartily. He got up from his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chair; suddenly he glanced at the clock.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say, Auntie Con, isn’t your clock a bit slow? I’ve got to meet a man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at—at Paddington just after five. I’m afraid I shan’t be able to stay,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,very long with grandfather.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, he won’t expect you to stay _very_ long!” said Aunt Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia was still gazing at the clock. She couldn’t make up her mind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"if it was fast or slow. It was one or the other, she felt almost",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"certain of that. At any rate, it had been.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Cyril still lingered. “Aren’t you coming along, Auntie Con?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Of course,” said Josephine, “we shall all go. Come on, Con.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,IX,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They knocked at the door, and Cyril followed his aunts into",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"grandfather’s hot, sweetish room.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come on,” said Grandfather Pinner. “Don’t hang about. What is it?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What’ve you been up to?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He was sitting in front of a roaring fire, clasping his stick. He had a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thick rug over his knees. On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,silk handkerchief.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s Cyril, father,” said Josephine shyly. And she took Cyril’s hand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and led him forward.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good afternoon, grandfather,” said Cyril, trying to take his hand out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of Aunt Josephine’s. Grandfather Pinner shot his eyes at Cyril in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,way he was famous for. Where was Auntie Con? She stood on the other,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,side of Aunt Josephine; her long arms hung down in front of her; her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hands were clasped. She never took her eyes off grandfather.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well,” said Grandfather Pinner, beginning to thump, “what have you got",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to tell me?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"What had he, what had he got to tell him? Cyril felt himself smiling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like a perfect imbecile. The room was stifling, too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Aunt Josephine came to his rescue. She cried brightly, “Cyril says",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his father is still very fond of meringues, father dear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Eh?” said Grandfather Pinner, curving his hand like a purple",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meringue-shell over one ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine repeated, “Cyril says his father is still very fond of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meringues.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Can’t hear,” said old Colonel Pinner. And he waved Josephine away with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his stick, then pointed with his stick to Cyril. “Tell me what she’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"trying to say,” he said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"(My God!) “Must I?” said Cyril, blushing and staring at Aunt Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do, dear,” she smiled. “It will please him so much.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come on, out with it!” cried Colonel Pinner testily, beginning to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thump again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Cyril leaned forward and yelled, “Father’s still very fond of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meringues.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At that Grandfather Pinner jumped as though he had been shot.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t shout!” he cried. “What’s the matter with the boy? _Meringues!_,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What about ’em?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Aunt Josephine, must we go on?” groaned Cyril desperately.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s quite all right, dear boy,” said Aunt Josephine, as though he and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she were at the dentist’s together. “He’ll understand in a minute.” And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she whispered to Cyril, “He’s getting a bit deaf, you know.” Then she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"leaned forward and really bawled at Grandfather Pinner, “Cyril only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wanted to tell you, father dear, that _his_ father is still very fond",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of meringues.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Colonel Pinner heard that time, heard and brooded, looking Cyril up and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What an esstrordinary thing!” said old Grandfather Pinner. “What an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,esstrordinary thing to come all this way here to tell me!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And Cyril felt it _was_.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, I shall send Cyril the watch,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That would be very nice,” said Constantia. “I seem to remember last",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,time he came there was some little trouble about the time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,X,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,They were interrupted by Kate bursting through the door in her usual,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fashion, as though she had discovered some secret panel in the wall.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Fried or boiled?” asked the bold voice.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Fried or boiled? Josephine and Constantia were quite bewildered for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,moment. They could hardly take it in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Fried or boiled what, Kate?” asked Josephine, trying to begin to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,concentrate.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kate gave a loud sniff. “Fish.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, why didn’t you say so immediately?” Josephine reproached her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gently. “How could you expect us to understand, Kate? There are a great",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"many things in this world you know, which are fried or boiled.” And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after such a display of courage she said quite brightly to Constantia,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Which do you prefer, Con?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I think it might be nice to have it fried,” said Constantia. “On the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other hand, of course, boiled fish is very nice. I think I prefer both",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,equally well.... Unless you.... In that case—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I shall fry it,” said Kate, and she bounced back, leaving their door",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,open and slamming the door of her kitchen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine gazed at Constantia; she raised her pale eyebrows until they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rippled away into her pale hair. She got up. She said in a very lofty,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"imposing way, “Do you mind following me into the drawing-room,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia? I’ve got something of great importance to discuss with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,For it was always to the drawing-room they retired when they wanted to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,talk over Kate.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine closed the door meaningly. “Sit down, Constantia,” she said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,still very grand. She might have been receiving Constantia for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"first time. And Con looked round vaguely for a chair, as though she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,felt indeed quite a stranger.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Now the question is,” said Josephine, bending forward, “whether we",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shall keep her or not.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That is the question,” agreed Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And this time,” said Josephine firmly, “we must come to a definite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,decision.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia looked for a moment as though she might begin going over all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the other times, but she pulled herself together and said, “Yes, Jug.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You see, Con,” explained Josephine, “everything is so changed now.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia looked up quickly. “I mean,” went on Josephine, “we’re not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dependent on Kate as we were.” And she blushed faintly. “There’s not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,father to cook for.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That is perfectly true,” agreed Constantia. “Father certainly doesn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"want any cooking now, whatever else—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine broke in sharply, “You’re not sleepy, are you, Con?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Sleepy, Jug?” Constantia was wide-eyed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, concentrate more,” said Josephine sharply, and she returned to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the subject. “What it comes to is, if we did”—and this she barely",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"breathed, glancing at the door—“give Kate notice”—she raised her voice",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,again—“we could manage our own food.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Why not?” cried Constantia. She couldn’t help smiling. The idea was so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"exciting. She clasped her hands. “What should we live on, Jug?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, eggs in various forms!” said Jug, lofty again. “And, besides,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there are all the cooked foods.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But I’ve always heard,” said Constantia, “they are considered so very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expensive.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not if one buys them in moderation,” said Josephine. But she tore",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,herself away from this fascinating bypath and dragged Constantia after,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What we’ve got to decide now, however, is whether we really do trust",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Kate or not.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia leaned back. Her flat little laugh flew from her lips.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Isn’t it curious, Jug,” said she, “that just on this one subject I’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,never been able to quite make up my mind?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,XI,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She never had. The whole difficulty was to prove anything. How did one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"prove things, how could one? Suppose Kate had stood in front of her and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,deliberately made a face. Mightn’t she very well have been in pain?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Wasn’t it impossible, at any rate, to ask Kate if she was making a face",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at her? If Kate answered “No”—and, of course, she would say “No”—what a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"position! How undignified! Then again Constantia suspected, she was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,almost certain that Kate went to her chest of drawers when she and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Josephine were out, not to take things but to spy. Many times she had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"come back to find her amethyst cross in the most unlikely places, under",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her lace ties or on top of her evening Bertha. More than once she had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,laid a trap for Kate. She had arranged things in a special order and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,then called Josephine to witness.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You see, Jug?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Quite, Con.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Now we shall be able to tell.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But, oh dear, when she did go to look, she was as far off from a proof",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as ever! If anything was displaced, it might so very well have happened",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as she closed the drawer; a jolt might have done it so easily.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You come, Jug, and decide. I really can’t. It’s too difficult.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But after a pause and a long glare Josephine would sigh, “Now you’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"put the doubt into my mind, Con, I’m sure I can’t tell myself.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, we can’t postpone it again,” said Josephine. “If we postpone it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this time—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,XII,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine and Constantia sprang to their feet together.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Run, Con,” said Josephine. “Run quickly. There’s sixpence on the—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Then they remembered. It didn’t matter. They would never have to stop,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the organ-grinder again. Never again would she and Constantia be told,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to make that monkey take his noise somewhere else. Never would sound,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that loud, strange bellow when father thought they were not hurrying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,enough. The organ-grinder might play there all day and the stick would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not thump.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     It never will thump again,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     It never will thump again,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,played the barrel-organ.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What was Constantia thinking? She had such a strange smile; she looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,different. She couldn’t be going to cry.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Jug, Jug,” said Constantia softly, pressing her hands together. “Do",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you know what day it is? It’s Saturday. It’s a week to-day, a whole",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,week.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     A week since father died,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     A week since father died,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cried the barrel-organ. And Josephine, too, forgot to be practical and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sensible; she smiled faintly, strangely. On the Indian carpet there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fell a square of sunlight, pale red; it came and went and came—and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stayed, deepened—until it shone almost golden.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“The sun’s out,” said Josephine, as though it really mattered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A perfect fountain of bubbling notes shook from the barrel-organ,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"round, bright notes, carelessly scattered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Constantia lifted her big, cold hands as if to catch them, and then her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hands fell again. She walked over to the mantelpiece to her favourite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Buddha. And the stone and gilt image, whose smile always gave her such",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a queer feeling, almost a pain and yet a pleasant pain, seemed to-day",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to be more than smiling. He knew something; he had a secret. “I know,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something that you don’t know,” said her Buddha. Oh, what was it, what",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could it be? And yet she had always felt there was... something.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The sunlight pressed through the windows, thieved its way in, flashed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,its light over the furniture and the photographs. Josephine watched it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"When it came to mother’s photograph, the enlargement over the piano, it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lingered as though puzzled to find so little remained of mother, except",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the earrings shaped like tiny pagodas and a black feather boa. Why did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the photographs of dead people always fade so? wondered Josephine. As,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"soon as a person was dead their photograph died too. But, of course,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this one of mother was very old. It was thirty-five years old.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine remembered standing on a chair and pointing out that feather,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,boa to Constantia and telling her that it was a snake that had killed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,their mother in Ceylon.... Would everything have been different if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mother hadn’t died? She didn’t see why. Aunt Florence had lived with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them until they had left school, and they had moved three times and had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"their yearly holiday and... and there’d been changes of servants, of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,course.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Some little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,window-ledge. _Yeep—eyeep—yeep._ But Josephine felt they were not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sparrows, not on the window-ledge. It was inside her, that queer little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"crying noise. _Yeep—eyeep—yeep._ Ah, what was it crying, so weak and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,forlorn?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"If mother had lived, might they have married? But there had been nobody",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for them to marry. There had been father’s Anglo-Indian friends before,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he quarrelled with them. But after that she and Constantia never met a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,single man except clergymen. How did one meet men? Or even if they’d,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"met them, how could they have got to know men well enough to be more",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"than strangers? One read of people having adventures, being followed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and so on. But nobody had ever followed Constantia and her. Oh yes,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there had been one year at Eastbourne a mysterious man at their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,boarding-house who had put a note on the jug of hot water outside their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bedroom door! But by the time Connie had found it the steam had made,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the writing too faint to read; they couldn’t even make out to which of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,them it was addressed. And he had left next day. And that was all. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rest had been looking after father, and at the same time keeping out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,father’s way. But now? But now? The thieving sun touched Josephine,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gently. She lifted her face. She was drawn over to the window by gentle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beams....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Until the barrel-organ stopped playing Constantia stayed before the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Buddha, wondering, but not as usual, not vaguely. This time her wonder",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was like longing. She remembered the times she had come in here, crept",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out of bed in her nightgown when the moon was full, and lain on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"floor with her arms outstretched, as though she was crucified. Why? The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"big, pale moon had made her do it. The horrible dancing figures on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,carved screen had leered at her and she hadn’t minded. She remembered,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"too how, whenever they were at the seaside, she had gone off by herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and got as close to the sea as she could, and sung something, something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she had made up, while she gazed all over that restless water. There",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"had been this other life, running out, bringing things home in bags,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"getting things on approval, discussing them with Jug, and taking them",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back to get more things on approval, and arranging father’s trays and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,trying not to annoy father. But it all seemed to have happened in a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kind of tunnel. It wasn’t real. It was only when she came out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,really felt herself. What did it mean? What was it she was always,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wanting? What did it all lead to? Now? Now?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,went over to where Josephine was standing. She wanted to say something,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to Josephine, something frightfully important, about—about the future",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and what....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t you think perhaps—” she began.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Josephine interrupted her. “I was wondering if now—” she murmured.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,They stopped; they waited for each other.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Go on, Con,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, no, Jug; after you,” said Constantia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, say what you were going to say. You began,” said Josephine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I... I’d rather hear what you were going to say first,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Constantia.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Don’t be absurd, Con.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Really, Jug.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, _Jug_!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"say, Jug, because I’ve forgotten what it was... that I was going to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Josephine was silent for a moment. She stared at a big cloud where the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sun had been. Then she replied shortly, “I’ve forgotten too.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"Of course he knew—no man better—that he hadn’t a ghost of a chance, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hadn’t an earthly. The very idea of such a thing was preposterous. So,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"preposterous that he’d perfectly understand it if her father—well,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"whatever her father chose to do he’d perfectly understand. In fact,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nothing short of desperation, nothing short of the fact that this was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"positively his last day in England for God knows how long, would have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,screwed him up to it. And even now.... He chose a tie out of the chest,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of drawers, a blue and cream check tie, and sat on the side of his bed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Supposing she replied, “What impertinence!” would he be surprised? Not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in the least, he decided, turning up his soft collar and turning it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down over the tie. He expected her to say something like that. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"didn’t see, if he looked at the affair dead soberly, what else she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could say.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Here he was! And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror, jammed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his hair down with both hands, pulled out the flaps of his jacket",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pockets. Making between £500 and £600 a year on a fruit farm in—of all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,places—Rhodesia. No capital. Not a penny coming to him. No chance of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his income increasing for at least four years. As for looks and all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that sort of thing, he was completely out of the running. He couldn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even boast of top-hole health, for the East Africa business had knocked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him out so thoroughly that he’d had to take six months’ leave. He was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"still fearfully pale—worse even than usual this afternoon, he thought,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bending forward and peering into the mirror. Good heavens! What had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"happened? His hair looked almost bright green. Dash it all, he hadn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,green hair at all events. That was a bit too steep. And then the green,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,light trembled in the glass; it was the shadow from the tree outside.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reggie turned away, took out his cigarette case, but remembering how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the mater hated him to smoke in his bedroom, put it back again and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"drifted over to the chest of drawers. No, he was dashed if he could",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"think of one blessed thing in his favour, while she.... Ah!... He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stopped dead, folded his arms, and leaned hard against the chest of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drawers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And in spite of her position, her father’s wealth, the fact that she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was an only child and far and away the most popular girl in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,neighbourhood; in spite of her beauty and her cleverness—cleverness!—it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was a great deal more than that, there was really nothing she couldn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"do; he fully believed, had it been necessary, she would have been a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"genius at anything—in spite of the fact that her parents adored her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and she them, and they’d as soon let her go all that way as.... In",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"spite of every single thing you could think of, so terrific was his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"love that he couldn’t help hoping. Well, was it hope? Or was this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"queer, timid longing to have the chance of looking after her, of making",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it his job to see that she had everything she wanted, and that nothing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,came near her that wasn’t perfect—just love? How he loved her! He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"squeezed hard against the chest of drawers and murmured to it, “I love",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her, I love her!” And just for the moment he was with her on the way to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Umtali. It was night. She sat in a corner asleep. Her soft chin was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tucked into her soft collar, her gold-brown lashes lay on her cheeks.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He doted on her delicate little nose, her perfect lips, her ear like a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"baby’s, and the gold-brown curl that half covered it. They were passing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through the jungle. It was warm and dark and far away. Then she woke up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and said, “Have I been asleep?” and he answered, “Yes. Are you all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"right? Here, let me—” And he leaned forward to.... He bent over her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,This was such bliss that he could dream no further. But it gave him the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"courage to bound downstairs, to snatch his straw hat from the hall, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to say as he closed the front door, “Well, I can only try my luck,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that’s all.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,immediately. Promenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Biddy, the ancient Pekes, was the mater. Of course Reginald was fond of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the mater and all that. She—she meant well, she had no end of grit, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"so on. But there was no denying it, she was rather a grim parent. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there had been moments, many of them, in Reggie’s life, before Uncle",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Alick died and left him the fruit farm, when he was convinced that to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be a widow’s only son was about the worst punishment a chap could have.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And what made it rougher than ever was that she was positively all that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he had. She wasn’t only a combined parent, as it were, but she had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quarrelled with all her own and the governor’s relations before Reggie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had won his first trouser pockets. So that whenever Reggie was homesick,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out there, sitting on his dark veranda by starlight, while the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gramophone cried, “Dear, what is Life but Love?” his only vision was of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the mater, tall and stout, rustling down the garden path, with Chinny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and Biddy at her heels....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The mater, with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something or other, stopped at the sight of Reggie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You are not going out, Reginald?” she asked, seeing that he was.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ll be back for tea, mater,” said Reggie weakly, plunging his hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,into his jacket pockets.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Snip. Off came a head. Reggie almost jumped.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"afternoon,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Silence. The Pekes stared. They understood every word of the mater’s.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out; she was so fat and glossy she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked like a lump of half-melted toffee. But Chinny’s porcelain eyes,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gloomed at Reginald, and he sniffed faintly, as though the whole world",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were one unpleasant smell. Snip, went the scissors again. Poor little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beggars; they were getting it!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And where are you going, if your mother may ask?” asked the mater.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It was over at last, but Reggie did not slow down until he was out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sight of the house and half-way to Colonel Proctor’s. Then only he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,noticed what a top-hole afternoon it was. It had been raining all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"morning, late summer rain, warm, heavy, quick, and now the sky was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"clear, except for a long tail of little clouds, like ducklings, sailing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,over the forest. There was just enough wind to shake the last drops off,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the trees; one warm star splashed on his hand. Ping!—another drummed on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his hat. The empty road gleamed, the hedges smelled of briar, and how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,big and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage gardens. And here,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was Colonel Proctor’s—here it was already. His hand was on the gate,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his elbow jogged the syringa bushes, and petals and pollen scattered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,over his coat sleeve. But wait a bit. This was too quick altogether.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He’d meant to think the whole thing out again. Here, steady. But he was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"walking up the path, with the huge rose bushes on either side. It can’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"be done like this. But his hand had grasped the bell, given it a pull,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and started it pealing wildly, as if he’d come to say the house was on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fire. The housemaid must have been in the hall, too, for the front door",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flashed open, and Reggie was shut in the empty drawing-room before that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"confounded bell had stopped ringing. Strangely enough, when it did, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"big room, shadowy, with some one’s parasol lying on top of the grand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"piano, bucked him up—or rather, excited him. It was so quiet, and yet",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in one moment the door would open, and his fate be decided. The feeling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was not unlike that of being at the dentist’s; he was almost reckless.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But at the same time, to his immense surprise, Reggie heard himself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saying, “Lord, Thou knowest, Thou hast not done _much_ for me....” That",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pulled him up; that made him realize again how dead serious it was. Too,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"late. The door handle turned. Anne came in, crossed the shadowy space",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"between them, gave him her hand, and said, in her small, soft voice,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m so sorry, father is out. And mother is having a day in town,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hat-hunting. There’s only me to entertain you, Reggie.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reggie gasped, pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons, and stammered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out, “As a matter of fact, I’ve only come... to say good-bye.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh!” cried Anne softly—she stepped back from him and her grey eyes,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,danced—“what a _very_ short visit!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Then, watching him, her chin tilted, she laughed outright, a long, soft",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"peal, and walked away from him over to the piano, and leaned against",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it, playing with the tassel of the parasol.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m so sorry,” she said, “to be laughing like this. I don’t know why I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"do. It’s just a bad ha-habit.” And suddenly she stamped her grey shoe,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and took a pocket-handkerchief out of her white woolly jacket. “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"really must conquer it, it’s too absurd,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good heavens, Anne,” cried Reggie, “I love to hear you laughing! I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,can’t imagine anything more—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But the truth was, and they both knew it, she wasn’t always laughing;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it wasn’t really a habit. Only ever since the day they’d met, ever",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"since that very first moment, for some strange reason that Reggie",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wished to God he understood, Anne had laughed at him. Why? It didn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,matter where they were or what they were talking about. They might,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"begin by being as serious as possible, dead serious—at any rate, as far",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as he was concerned—but then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Anne would glance at him, and a little quick quiver passed over her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"face. Her lips parted, her eyes danced, and she began laughing.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Another queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea she didn’t herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"know why she laughed. He had seen her turn away, frown, suck in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cheeks, press her hands together. But it was no use. The long, soft",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"peal sounded, even while she cried, “I don’t know why I’m laughing.” It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was a mystery....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Now she tucked the handkerchief away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do sit down,” said she. “And smoke, won’t you? There are cigarettes in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that little box beside you. I’ll have one too.” He lighted a match for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her, and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow in the pearl",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ring she wore. “It is to-morrow that you’re going, isn’t it?” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Anne.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, to-morrow as ever was,” said Reggie, and he blew a little fan of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smoke. Why on earth was he so nervous? Nervous wasn’t the word for it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s—it’s frightfully hard to believe,” he added.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes—isn’t it?” said Anne softly, and she leaned forward and rolled the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,point of her cigarette round the green ash-tray. How beautiful she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked like that!—simply beautiful—and she was so small in that immense,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chair. Reginald’s heart swelled with tenderness, but it was her voice,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her soft voice, that made him tremble. “I feel you’ve been here for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"years,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reginald took a deep breath of his cigarette. “It’s ghastly, this idea",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of going back,” he said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“_Coo-roo-coo-coo-coo_,” sounded from the quiet.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But you’re fond of being out there, aren’t you?” said Anne. She hooked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her finger through her pearl necklace. “Father was saying only the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,other night how lucky he thought you were to have a life of your own.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And she looked up at him. Reginald’s smile was rather wan. “I don’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"feel fearfully lucky,” he said lightly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“_Roo-coo-coo-coo_,” came again. And Anne murmured, “You mean it’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lonely.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, it isn’t the loneliness I care about,” said Reginald, and he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stumped his cigarette savagely on the green ash-tray. “I could stand,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"any amount of it, used to like it even. It’s the idea of—” Suddenly, to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his horror, he felt himself blushing.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!_”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Anne jumped up. “Come and say good-bye to my doves,” she said. “They’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"been moved to the side veranda. You do like doves, don’t you, Reggie?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Awfully,” said Reggie, so fervently that as he opened the French",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"window for her and stood to one side, Anne ran forward and laughed at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the doves instead.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"To and fro, to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"house, walked the two doves. One was always in front of the other. One",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ran forward, uttering a little cry, and the other followed, solemnly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bowing and bowing. “You see,” explained Anne, “the one in front, she’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Mrs. Dove. She looks at Mr. Dove and gives that little laugh and runs,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"forward, and he follows her, bowing and bowing. And that makes her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"laugh again. Away she runs, and after her,” cried Anne, and she sat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back on her heels, “comes poor Mr. Dove, bowing and bowing... and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that’s their whole life. They never do anything else, you know.” She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,got up and took some yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"house. “When you think of them, out in Rhodesia, Reggie, you can be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sure that is what they will be doing....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Reggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,For the moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tear his secret out of himself and offer it to Anne. “Anne, do you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,think you could ever care for me?” It was done. It was over. And in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little pause that followed Reginald saw the garden open to the light,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the blue quivering sky, the flutter of leaves on the veranda poles, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Anne turning over the grains of maize on her palm with one finger. Then,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"slowly she shut her hand, and the new world faded as she murmured",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"slowly, “No, never in that way.” But he had scarcely time to feel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"anything before she walked quickly away, and he followed her down the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"steps, along the garden path, under the pink rose arches, across the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lawn. There, with the gay herbaceous border behind her, Anne faced",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reginald. “It isn’t that I’m not awfully fond of you,” she said. “I am.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But”—her eyes widened—“not in the way”—a quiver passed over her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"face—“one ought to be fond of—” Her lips parted, and she couldn’t stop",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"herself. She began laughing. “There, you see, you see,” she cried,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“it’s your check t-tie. Even at this moment, when one would think one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"really would be solemn, your tie reminds me fearfully of the bow-tie",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that cats wear in pictures! Oh, please forgive me for being so horrid,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,please!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Reggie caught hold of her little warm hand. “There’s no question of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"forgiving you,” he said quickly. “How could there be? And I do believe",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I know why I make you laugh. It’s because you’re so far above me in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"every way that I am somehow ridiculous. I see that, Anne. But if I were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, no.” Anne squeezed his hand hard. “It’s not that. That’s all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wrong. I’m not far above you at all. You’re much better than I am.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,You’re marvellously unselfish and... and kind and simple. I’m none of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"those things. You don’t know me. I’m the most awful character,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Anne. “Please don’t interrupt. And besides, that’s not the point. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,point is”—she shook her head—“I couldn’t possibly marry a man I laughed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at. Surely you see that. The man I marry—” breathed Anne softly. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"broke off. She drew her hand away, and looking at Reggie she smiled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strangely, dreamily. “The man I marry—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And it seemed to Reggie that a tall, handsome, brilliant stranger",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stepped in front of him and took his place—the kind of man that Anne,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and he had seen often at the theatre, walking on to the stage from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nowhere, without a word catching the heroine in his arms, and after one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"long, tremendous look, carrying her off to anywhere....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reggie bowed to his vision. “Yes, I see,” he said huskily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do you?” said Anne. “Oh, I do hope you do. Because I feel so horrid",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about it. It’s so hard to explain. You know I’ve never—” She stopped.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Reggie looked at her. She was smiling. “Isn’t it funny?” she said. “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,can say anything to you. I always have been able to from the very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beginning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He tried to smile, to say “I’m glad.” She went on. “I’ve never known",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,anyone I like as much as I like you. I’ve never felt so happy with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,anyone. But I’m sure it’s not what people and what books mean when they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"talk about love. Do you understand? Oh, if you only knew how horrid I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,feel. But we’d be like... like Mr. and Mrs. Dove.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"That did it. That seemed to Reginald final, and so terribly true that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he could hardly bear it. “Don’t drive it home,” he said, and he turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,away from Anne and looked across the lawn. There was the gardener’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cottage, with the dark ilex-tree beside it. A wet, blue thumb of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,transparent smoke hung above the chimney. It didn’t look real. How his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,throat ached! Could he speak? He had a shot. “I must be getting along,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"home,” he croaked, and he began walking across the lawn. But Anne ran",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"after him. “No, don’t. You can’t go yet,” she said imploringly. “You",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,can’t possibly go away feeling like that.” And she stared up at him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"frowning, biting her lip.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, that’s all right,” said Reggie, giving himself a shake. “I’ll...",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I’ll—” And he waved his hand as much to say “get over it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But this is awful,” said Anne. She clasped her hands and stood in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"front of him. “Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t you?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, quite, quite,” said Reggie, looking at her with haggard eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do. I mean, it’s all very well for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Mr. and Mrs. Dove. But imagine that in real life—imagine it!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, absolutely,” said Reggie, and he started to walk on. But again",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Anne stopped him. She tugged at his sleeve, and to his astonishment,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"this time, instead of laughing, she looked like a little girl who was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,going to cry.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Then why, if you understand, are you so un-unhappy?” she wailed. “Why",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,do you mind so fearfully? Why do you look so aw-awful?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Reggie gulped, and again he waved something away. “I can’t help it,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"said, “I’ve had a blow. If I cut off now, I’ll be able to—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How can you talk of cutting off now?” said Anne scornfully. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stamped her foot at Reggie; she was crimson. “How can you be so cruel?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I can’t let you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as you were before you asked me to marry you. Surely you must see that,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it’s so simple.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But it did not seem at all simple to Reginald. It seemed impossibly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,difficult.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Even if I can’t marry you, how can I know that you’re all that way",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"away, with only that awful mother to write to, and that you’re",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"miserable, and that it’s all my fault?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“It’s not your fault. Don’t think that. It’s just fate.” Reggie took,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her hand off his sleeve and kissed it. “Don’t pity me, dear little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Anne,” he said gently. And this time he nearly ran, under the pink",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"arches, along the garden path.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!_” sounded from the veranda.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Reggie, Reggie,” from the garden.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He stopped, he turned. But when she saw his timid, puzzled look, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gave a little laugh.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come back, Mr. Dove,” said Anne. And Reginald came slowly across the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lawn.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,The Young Girl,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eyes, and her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time—pinned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,up to be out of the way for her flight—Mrs. Raddick’s daughter might,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"have just dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick’s timid,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"faintly astonished, but deeply admiring glance looked as if she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"believed it, too; but the daughter didn’t appear any too pleased—why",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"should she?—to have alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was bored—bored as though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,old saints for _croupiers_ and crowns to play with.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“You don’t mind taking Hennie?” said Mrs. Raddick. “Sure you don’t?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There’s the car, and you’ll have tea and we’ll be back here on this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"step—right here—in an hour. You see, I want her to go in. She’s not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"been before, and it’s worth seeing. I feel it wouldn’t be fair to her.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, shut up, mother,” said she wearily. “Come along. Don’t talk so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,much. And your bag’s open; you’ll be losing all your money again.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m sorry, darling,” said Mrs. Raddick.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“It’s all jolly well for you—but I’m broke!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here—take fifty francs, darling, take a hundred!” I saw Mrs. Raddick",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pressing notes into her hand as they passed through the swing doors.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hennie and I stood on the steps a minute, watching the people. He had a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very broad, delighted smile.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say,” he cried, “there’s an English bulldog. Are they allowed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,take dogs in there?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, they’re not.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"They frighten people so, and they’re never fierce with their—the people",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"they belong to.” Suddenly he squeezed my arm. “I say, _do_ look at that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,old woman. Who is she? Why does she look like that? Is she a gambler?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The ancient, withered creature, wearing a green satin dress, a black",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"velvet cloak and a white hat with purple feathers, jerked slowly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,slowly up the steps as though she were being drawn up on wires. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stared in front of her, she was laughing and nodding and cackling to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,herself; her claws clutched round what looked like a dirty boot-bag.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But just at that moment there was Mrs. Raddick again with—_her_—and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,another lady hovering in the background. Mrs. Raddick rushed at me. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was brightly flushed, gay, a different creature. She was like a woman",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"who is saying “good-bye” to her friends on the station platform, with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not a minute to spare before the train starts.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, you’re here, still. Isn’t that lucky! You’ve not gone. Isn’t that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fine! I’ve had the most dreadful time with—her,” and she waved to her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"daughter, who stood absolutely still, disdainful, looking down,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"twiddling her foot on the step, miles away. “They won’t let her in. I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,swore she was twenty-one. But they won’t believe me. I showed the man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,my purse; I didn’t dare to do more. But it was no use. He simply,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"scoffed.... And now I’ve just met Mrs. MacEwen from New York, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,just won thirteen thousand in the _Salle Privée_—and she wants me to go,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,back with her while the luck lasts. Of course I can’t leave—her. But if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you’d—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At that “she” looked up; she simply withered her mother. “Why can’t you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leave me?” she said furiously. “What utter rot! How dare you make a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,scene like this? This is the last time I’ll come out with you. You,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,really are too awful for words.” She looked her mother up and down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Calm yourself,” she said superbly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mrs. Raddick was desperate, just desperate. She was “wild” to go back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with Mrs. MacEwen, but at the same time....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I seized my courage. “Would you—do you care to come to tea with—us?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, yes, she’ll be delighted. That’s just what I wanted, isn’t it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,I’ll—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Mrs. R. dashed up the steps. I saw her bag was open again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,So we three were left. But really it wasn’t my fault. Hennie looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"crushed to the earth, too. When the car was there she wrapped her dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,coat round her—to escape contamination. Even her little feet looked as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,though they scorned to carry her down the steps to us.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I am so awfully sorry,” I murmured as the car started.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, I don’t _mind_,” said she. “I don’t _want_ to look twenty-one. Who",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would—if they were seventeen! It’s”—and she gave a faint shudder—“the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stupidity I loathe, and being stared at by old fat men. Beasts!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie gave her a quick look and then peered out of the window.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,We drew up before an immense palace of pink-and-white marble with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,orange-trees outside the doors in gold-and-black tubs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Would you care to go in?” I suggested.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She hesitated, glanced, bit her lip, and resigned herself. “Oh well,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there seems nowhere else,” said she. “Get out, Hennie.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I went first—to find the table, of course—she followed. But the worst",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of it was having her little brother, who was only twelve, with us. That",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was the last, final straw—having that child, trailing at her heels.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,There was one table. It had pink carnations and pink plates with little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,blue tea-napkins for sails.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Shall we sit here?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She put her hand wearily on the back of a white wicker chair.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“We may as well. Why not?” said she.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie squeezed past her and wriggled on to a stool at the end. He felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,awfully out of it. She didn’t even take her gloves off. She lowered her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eyes and drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and bit her lip again. Silence.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The waitress appeared. I hardly dared to ask her. “Tea—coffee? China,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tea—or iced tea with lemon?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Really she didn’t mind. It was all the same to her. She didn’t really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"want anything. Hennie whispered, “Chocolate!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But just as the waitress turned away she cried out carelessly, “Oh, you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"may as well bring me a chocolate, too.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"While we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dabbed her lovely nose.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hennie,” she said, “take those flowers away.” She pointed with her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"puff to the carnations, and I heard her murmur, “I can’t bear flowers",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on a table.” They had evidently been giving her intense pain, for she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,positively closed her eyes as I moved them away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The waitress came back with the chocolate and the tea. She put the big,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass. Hennie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"buried his nose, emerged, with, for one dreadful moment, a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,trembling blob of cream on the tip. But he hastily wiped it off like a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little gentleman. I wondered if I should dare draw her attention to her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cup. She didn’t notice it—didn’t see it—until suddenly, quite by",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chance, she took a sip. I watched anxiously; she faintly shuddered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Dreadfully sweet!” said she.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A tiny boy with a head like a raisin and a chocolate body came round,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with a tray of pastries—row upon row of little freaks, little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"inspirations, little melting dreams. He offered them to her. “Oh, I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not at all hungry. Take them away.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He offered them to Hennie. Hennie gave me a swift look—it must have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"been satisfactory—for he took a chocolate cream, a coffee éclair, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,meringue stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,strawberries. She could hardly bear to watch him. But just as the boy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,swerved away she held up her plate.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh well, give me _one_,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The silver tongs dropped one, two, three—and a cherry tartlet. “I don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"know why you’re giving me all these,” she said, and nearly smiled. “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shan’t eat them; I couldn’t!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I felt much more comfortable. I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"asked if I might smoke. At that she paused, the fork in her hand,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"opened her eyes, and really did smile. “Of course,” said she. “I always",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expect people to.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But at that moment a tragedy happened to Hennie. He speared his pastry,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"horn too hard, and it flew in two, and one half spilled on the table.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ghastly affair! He turned crimson. Even his ears flared, and one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ashamed hand crept across the table to take what was left of the body,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“You _utter_ little beast!” said she.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Good heavens! I had to fly to the rescue. I cried hastily, “Will you be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,abroad long?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But she had already forgotten Hennie. I was forgotten, too. She was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“I—don’t—know,” she said slowly, from that far place.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I suppose you prefer it to London. It’s more—more—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“More—?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“_Enfin_—gayer,” I cried, waving my cigarette.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But that took a whole cake to consider. Even then, “Oh well, that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,depends!” was all she could safely say.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie had finished. He was still very warm.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I seized the butterfly list off the table. “I say—what about an ice,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hennie? What about tangerine and ginger? No, something cooler. What",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about a fresh pineapple cream?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie strongly approved. The waitress had her eye on us. The order was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,taken when she looked up from her crumbs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Did you say tangerine and ginger? I like ginger. You can bring me,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"one.” And then quickly, “I wish that orchestra wouldn’t play things",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,from the year One. We were dancing to that all last Christmas. It’s too,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sickening!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But it was a charming air. Now that I noticed it, it warmed me.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I think this is rather a nice place, don’t you, Hennie?” I said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hennie said: “Ripping!” He meant to say it very low, but it came out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,very high in a kind of squeak.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Nice? This place? Nice? For the first time she stared about her, trying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to see what there was.... She blinked; her lovely eyes wondered. A very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,good-looking elderly man stared back at her through a monocle on a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,black ribbon. But him she simply couldn’t see. There was a hole in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,air where he was. She looked through and through him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,Finally the little flat spoons lay still on the glass plates. Hennie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"looked rather exhausted, but she pulled on her white gloves again. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had some trouble with her diamond wrist-watch; it got in her way. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tugged at it—tried to break the stupid little thing—it wouldn’t break.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Finally, she had to drag her glove over. I saw, after that, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"couldn’t stand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and turned away while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tea.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And then we were outside again. It had grown dusky. The sky was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sprinkled with small stars; the big lamps glowed. While we waited for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the car to come up she stood on the step, just as before, twiddling her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"foot, looking down.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie bounded forward to open the door and she got in and sank back,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with—oh—such a sigh!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tell him,” she gasped, “to drive as fast as he can.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hennie grinned at his friend the chauffeur. “_Allie veet!_” said he.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Then he composed himself and sat on the small seat facing us.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The gold powder-box came out again. Again the poor little puff was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shaken; again there was that swift, deadly-secret glance between her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and the mirror.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,We tore through the black-and-gold town like a pair of scissors tearing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through brocade. Hennie had great difficulty not to look as though he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were hanging on to something.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And when we reached the Casino, of course Mrs. Raddick wasn’t there.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,There wasn’t a sign of her on the steps—not a sign.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Will you stay in the car while I go and look?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But no—she wouldn’t do that. Good heavens, no! Hennie could stay. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,couldn’t bear sitting in a car. She’d wait on the steps.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But I scarcely like to leave you,” I murmured. “I’d very much rather",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not leave you here.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At that she threw back her coat; she turned and faced me; her lips,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,parted. “Good heavens—why! I—I don’t mind it a bit. I—I like waiting.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And suddenly her cheeks crimsoned, her eyes grew dark—for a moment I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thought she was going to cry. “L—let me, please,” she stammered, in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"warm, eager voice. “I like it. I love waiting! Really—really I do! I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,Life of Ma Parker,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"When the literary gentleman, whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Tuesday, opened the door to her that morning, he asked after her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"grandson. Ma Parker stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and she stretched out her hand to help her gentleman shut the door,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"before she replied. “We buried ’im yesterday, sir,” she said quietly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, dear me! I’m sorry to hear that,” said the literary gentleman in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shocked tone. He was in the middle of his breakfast. He wore a very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand. But,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he felt awkward. He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,without saying something—something more. Then because these people set,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"such store by funerals he said kindly, “I hope the funeral went off all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,right.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Beg parding, sir?” said old Ma Parker huskily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Poor old bird! She did look dashed. “I hope the funeral was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a—a—success,” said he. Ma Parker gave no answer. She bent her head and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hobbled off to the kitchen, clasping the old fish bag that held her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes. The literary,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gentleman raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Overcome, I suppose,” he said aloud, helping himself to the marmalade.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Ma Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the door. She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too. Then she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots. To take off her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"boots or to put them on was an agony to her, but it had been an agony",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for years. In fact, she was so accustomed to the pain that her face was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drawn and screwed up ready for the twinge before she’d so much as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"untied the laces. That over, she sat back with a sigh and softly rubbed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her knees....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Gran! Gran!” Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button boots.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“Look what a state you’ve made your gran’s skirt into—you wicked boy!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Well, what’ll you give your gran?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The old woman sprang up, seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,took it over to the sink. The noise of the water drumming in the kettle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"deadened her pain, it seemed. She filled the pail, too, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,washing-up bowl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,During the week the literary gentleman “did” for himself. That is to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"say, he emptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for that purpose, and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"two on the roller towel. Otherwise, as he explained to his friends, his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“system” was quite simple, and he couldn’t understand why people made",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all this fuss about housekeeping.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You simply dirty everything you’ve got, get a hag in once a week to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"clean up, and the thing’s done.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The result looked like a gigantic dustbin. Even the floor was littered,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with toast crusts, envelopes, cigarette ends. But Ma Parker bore him no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grudge. She pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,after him. Out of the smudgy little window you could see an immense,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"expanse of sad-looking sky, and whenever there were clouds they looked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very worn, old clouds, frayed at the edges, with holes in them, or dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stains like tea.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"While the water was heating, Ma Parker began sweeping the floor. “Yes,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she thought, as the broom knocked, “what with one thing and another",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I’ve had my share. I’ve had a hard life.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Even the neighbours said that of her. Many a time, hobbling home with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her fish bag she heard them, waiting at the corner, or leaning over the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"area railings, say among themselves, “She’s had a hard life, has Ma",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Parker.” And it was so true she wasn’t in the least proud of it. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,just as if you were to say she lived in the basement-back at Number 27.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A hard life!...,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"something—a bush, there was—at the front door, that smelt ever so nice.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But the bush was very vague. She’d only remembered it once or twice in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the hospital, when she’d been taken bad.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,That was a dreadful place—her first place. She was never allowed out.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a fair cellar. And the cook was a cruel woman. She used to snatch away,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her letters from home before she’d read them, and throw them in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,range because they made her dreamy.... And the beedles! Would you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You might, _indeed_, Mrs. Parker!” said the gentleman, shuddering, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Yes, seven had gone, and while the six were still small her husband was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"taken ill with consumption. It was flour on the lungs, the doctor told",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her at the time.... Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“Now, if we were to cut him open _here_, Mrs. Parker,” said the doctor,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“you’d find his lungs chock-a-block with white powder. Breathe, my good",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"them to help things along, and she hadn’t been there more than two",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,months when she fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine. And for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,five years Ma Parker had another baby—and such a one for crying!—to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,look after. Then young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her; the two boys emigrated, and young Jim went to India with the army,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and Ethel, the youngest, married a good-for-nothing little waiter who",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He’d never been a strong child—never from the first. He’d been one of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in fact, he’d shown Mrs.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,woman.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"when she began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought of little Lennie was unbearable. Why did he have to suffer so?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,That’s what she couldn’t understand. Why should a little angel child,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have to arsk for his breath and fight for it? There was no sense in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,making a child suffer like that.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,... From Lennie’s little box of a chest there came a sound as though,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,something was boiling. There was a great lump of something bubbling in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his chest that he couldn’t get rid of. When he coughed the sweat sprang,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan. But what was more awful than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all was when he didn’t cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"herself, and never once had she been seen to cry. Never by a living",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"He was all she’d got from life, and now he was took too. Why must it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"her hat, put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a dream. She did not know what she was doing. She was like a person so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks away—anywhere,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,lock-up as like as not.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his gran’s arms. Ah, that’s what she wants to do, my dove. Gran wants",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to cry. If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everything, beginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to the doctor’s, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the children’s leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Lennie. But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"long time. All the same, the time for it had come. She must do it. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,couldn’t put it off any longer; she couldn’t wait any more.... Where,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could she go?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“She’s had a hard life, has Ma Parker.” Yes, a hard life, indeed! Her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chin began to tremble; there was no time to lose. But where? Where?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She couldn’t go home; Ethel was there. It would frighten Ethel out of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her life. She couldn’t sit on a bench anywhere; people would come,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,arsking her questions. She couldn’t possibly go back to the gentleman’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flat; she had no right to cry in strangers’ houses. If she sat on some,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,steps a policeman would speak to her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, wasn’t there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"herself and stay as long as she liked, not disturbing anybody, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nobody worrying her? Wasn’t there anywhere in the world where she could,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have her cry out—at last?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ma Parker stood, looking up and down. The icy wind blew out her apron",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,into a balloon. And now it began to rain. There was nowhere.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,On his way to the station William remembered with a fresh pang of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,disappointment that he was taking nothing down to the kiddies. Poor,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little chaps! It was hard lines on them. Their first words always were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as they ran to greet him, “What have you got for me, daddy?” and he had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nothing. He would have to buy them some sweets at the station. But that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was what he had done for the past four Saturdays; their faces had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fallen last time when they saw the same old boxes produced again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Paddy had said, “I had red ribbing on mine _bee_-fore!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Johnny had said, “It’s always pink on mine. I hate pink.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But what was William to do? The affair wasn’t so easily settled. In the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"old days, of course, he would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and chosen them something in five minutes. But nowadays they had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Russian toys, French toys, Serbian toys—toys from God knows where. It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was over a year since Isabel had scrapped the old donkeys and engines,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and so on because they were so “dreadfully sentimental” and “so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,appallingly bad for the babies’ sense of form.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s so important,” the new Isabel had explained, “that they should",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like the right things from the very beginning. It saves so much time,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"later on. Really, if the poor pets have to spend their infant years",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"staring at these horrors, one can imagine them growing up and asking to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be taken to the Royal Academy.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And she spoke as though a visit to the Royal Academy was certain,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,immediate death to anyone....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, I don’t know,” said William slowly. “When I was their age I used",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The new Isabel looked at him, her eyes narrowed, her lips apart.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“_Dear_ William! I’m sure you did!” She laughed in the new way.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Sweets it would have to be, however, thought William gloomily, fishing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in his pocket for change for the taxi-man. And he saw the kiddies,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,handing the boxes round—they were awfully generous little chaps—while,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Isabel’s precious friends didn’t hesitate to help themselves....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What about fruit? William hovered before a stall just inside the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"station. What about a melon each? Would they have to share that, too?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Or a pineapple, for Pad, and a melon for Johnny? Isabel’s friends could",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hardly go sneaking up to the nursery at the children’s meal-times. All,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the same, as he bought the melon William had a horrible vision of one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of Isabel’s young poets lapping up a slice, for some reason, behind the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nursery door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,With his two very awkward parcels he strode off to his train. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"platform was crowded, the train was in. Doors banged open and shut.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,There came such a loud hissing from the engine that people looked dazed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as they scurried to and fro. William made straight for a first-class,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smoker, stowed away his suit-case and parcels, and taking a huge wad of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"papers out of his inner pocket, he flung down in the corner and began",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to read.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Our client moreover is positive.... We are inclined to reconsider...,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in the event of—” Ah, that was better. William pressed back his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flattened hair and stretched his legs across the carriage floor. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,familiar dull gnawing in his breast quietened down. “With regard to our,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,decision—” He took out a blue pencil and scored a paragraph slowly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Two men came in, stepped across him, and made for the farther corner. A",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,young fellow swung his golf clubs into the rack and sat down opposite.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The train gave a gentle lurch, they were off. William glanced up and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw the hot, bright station slipping away. A red-faced girl raced along",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"by the carriages, there was something strained and almost desperate in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the way she waved and called. “Hysterical!” thought William dully. Then,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a greasy, black-faced workman at the end of the platform grinned at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"passing train. And William thought, “A filthy life!” and went back to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his papers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"When he looked up again there were fields, and beasts standing for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shelter under the dark trees. A wide river, with naked children",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"splashing in the shallows, glided into sight and was gone again. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sky shone pale, and one bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“We have examined our client’s correspondence files....” The last,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sentence he had read echoed in his mind. “We have examined....” William,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hung on to that sentence, but it was no good; it snapped in the middle,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and the fields, the sky, the sailing bird, the water, all said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Isabel.” The same thing happened every Saturday afternoon. When he was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on his way to meet Isabel there began those countless imaginary,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"meetings. She was at the station, standing just a little apart from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,everybody else; she was sitting in the open taxi outside; she was at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the garden gate; walking across the parched grass; at the door, or just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,inside the hall.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And her clear, light voice said, “It’s William,” or “Hillo, William!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"or “So William has come!” He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The exquisite freshness of Isabel! When he had been a little boy, it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was his delight to run into the garden after a shower of rain and shake,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the rose-bush over him. Isabel was that rose-bush, petal-soft,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sparkling and cool. And he was still that little boy. But there was no,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"running into the garden now, no laughing and shaking. The dull,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"persistent gnawing in his breast started again. He drew up his legs,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tossed the papers aside, and shut his eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What is it, Isabel? What is it?” he said tenderly. They were in their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bedroom in the new house. Isabel sat on a painted stool before the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dressing-table that was strewn with little black and green boxes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What is what, William?” And she bent forward, and her fine light hair",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fell over her cheeks.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ah, you know!” He stood in the middle of the room and he felt a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stranger. At that Isabel wheeled round quickly and faced him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, William!” she cried imploringly, and she held up the hair-brush:",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Please! Please don’t be so dreadfully stuffy and—tragic. You’re always,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,saying or looking or hinting that I’ve changed. Just because I’ve got,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to know really congenial people, and go about more, and am frightfully",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"keen on—on everything, you behave as though I’d—” Isabel tossed back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her hair and laughed—“killed our love or something. It’s so awfully,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"absurd”—she bit her lip—“and it’s so maddening, William. Even this new",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,house and the servants you grudge me.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Isabel!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, yes, it’s true in a way,” said Isabel quickly. “You think they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"are another bad sign. Oh, I know you do. I feel it,” she said softly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“every time you come up the stairs. But we couldn’t have gone on living,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in that other poky little hole, William. Be practical, at least! Why,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there wasn’t enough room for the babies even.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No, it was true. Every morning when he came back from chambers it was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to find the babies with Isabel in the back drawing-room. They were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"having rides on the leopard skin thrown over the sofa back, or they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were playing shops with Isabel’s desk for a counter, or Pad was sitting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on the hearthrug rowing away for dear life with a little brass fire,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shovel, while Johnny shot at pirates with the tongs. Every evening they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,each had a pick-a-back up the narrow stairs to their fat old Nanny.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Yes, he supposed it was a poky little house. A little white house with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,blue curtains and a window-box of petunias. William met their friends,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at the door with “Seen our petunias? Pretty terrific for London, don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you think?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But the imbecile thing, the absolutely extraordinary thing was that he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hadn’t the slightest idea that Isabel wasn’t as happy as he. God, what",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,blindness! He hadn’t the remotest notion in those days that she really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hated that inconvenient little house, that she thought the fat Nanny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was ruining the babies, that she was desperately lonely, pining for new",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,people and new music and pictures and so on. If they hadn’t gone to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that studio party at Moira Morrison’s—if Moira Morrison hadn’t said as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"they were leaving, “I’m going to rescue your wife, selfish man. She’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like an exquisite little Titania”—if Isabel hadn’t gone with Moira to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Paris—if—if....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The train stopped at another station. Bettingford. Good heavens! They’d,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be there in ten minutes. William stuffed that papers back into his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pockets; the young man opposite had long since disappeared. Now the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,other two got out. The late afternoon sun shone on women in cotton,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"frocks and little sunburnt, barefoot children. It blazed on a silky",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,yellow flower with coarse leaves which sprawled over a bank of rock.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The air ruffling through the window smelled of the sea. Had Isabel the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"same crowd with her this week-end, wondered William?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And he remembered the holidays they used to have, the four of them,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with a little farm girl, Rose, to look after the babies. Isabel wore a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,jersey and her hair in a plait; she looked about fourteen. Lord! how,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his nose used to peel! And the amount they ate, and the amount they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,slept in that immense feather bed with their feet locked together....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,William couldn’t help a grim smile as he thought of Isabel’s horror if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she knew the full extent of his sentimentality.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hillo, William!” She was at the station after all, standing just as he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"had imagined, apart from the others, and—William’s heart leapt—she was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,alone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hallo, Isabel!” William stared. He thought she looked so beautiful",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that he had to say something, “You look very cool.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do I?” said Isabel. “I don’t feel very cool. Come along, your horrid",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,old train is late. The taxi’s outside.” She put her hand lightly on his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"arm as they passed the ticket collector. “We’ve all come to meet you,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she said. “But we’ve left Bobby Kane at the sweet shop, to be called",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh!” said William. It was all he could say for the moment.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There in the glare waited the taxi, with Bill Hunt and Dennis Green",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sprawling on one side, their hats tilted over their faces, while on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other, Moira Morrison, in a bonnet like a huge strawberry, jumped up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“No ice! No ice! No ice!” she shouted gaily.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And Dennis chimed in from under his hat. “_Only_ to be had from the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fishmonger’s.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Bill Hunt, emerging, added, “With _whole_ fish in it.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, what a bore!” wailed Isabel. And she explained to William how they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had been chasing round the town for ice while she waited for him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Simply everything is running down the steep cliffs into the sea,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beginning with the butter.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter,” said Dennis. “May thy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"head, William, lack not ointment.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Look here,” said William, “how are we going to sit? I’d better get up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,by the driver.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, Bobby Kane’s by the driver,” said Isabel. “You’re to sit between",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Moira and me.” The taxi started. “What have you got in those mysterious,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,parcels?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“De-cap-it-ated heads!” said Bill Hunt, shuddering beneath his hat.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, fruit!” Isabel sounded very pleased. “Wise William! A melon and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pineapple. How too nice!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, wait a bit,” said William, smiling. But he really was anxious. “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brought them down for the kiddies.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, my dear!” Isabel laughed, and slipped her hand through his arm.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“They’d be rolling in agonies if they were to eat them. No”—she patted,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his hand—“you must bring them something next time. I refuse to part,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with my pineapple.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Cruel Isabel! Do let me smell it!” said Moira. She flung her arms,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,across William appealingly. “Oh!” The strawberry bonnet fell forward:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she sounded quite faint.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A Lady in Love with a Pineapple,” said Dennis, as the taxi drew up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"before a little shop with a striped blind. Out came Bobby Kane, his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,arms full of little packets.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I do hope they’ll be good. I’ve chosen them because of the colours.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,There are some round things which really look too divine. And just look,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at this nougat,” he cried ecstatically, “just look at it! It’s a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,perfect little ballet!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But at that moment the shopman appeared. “Oh, I forgot. They’re none of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them paid for,” said Bobby, looking frightened. Isabel gave the shopman",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a note, and Bobby was radiant again. “Hallo, William! I’m sitting by",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the driver.” And bareheaded, all in white, with his sleeves rolled up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to the shoulders, he leapt into his place. “Avanti!” he cried....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"After tea the others went off to bathe, while William stayed and made",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his peace with the kiddies. But Johnny and Paddy were asleep, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rose-red glow had paled, bats were flying, and still the bathers had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"not returned. As William wandered downstairs, the maid crossed the hall",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,carrying a lamp. He followed her into the sitting-room. It was a long,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"room, coloured yellow. On the wall opposite William some one had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"painted a young man, over life-size, with very wobbly legs, offering a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wide-eyed daisy to a young woman who had one very short arm and one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very long, thin one. Over the chairs and sofa there hung strips of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"black material, covered with big splashes like broken eggs, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,everywhere one looked there seemed to be an ash-tray full of cigarette,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ends. William sat down in one of the arm-chairs. Nowadays, when one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"felt with one hand down the sides, it wasn’t to come upon a sheep with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"three legs or a cow that had lost one horn, or a very fat dove out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the Noah’s Ark. One fished up yet another little paper-covered book of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smudged-looking poems.... He thought of the wad of papers in his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pocket, but he was too hungry and tired to read. The door was open;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sounds came from the kitchen. The servants were talking as if they were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,alone in the house. Suddenly there came a loud screech of laughter and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,an equally loud “Sh!” They had remembered him. William got up and went,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"through the French windows into the garden, and as he stood there in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the shadow he heard the bathers coming up the sandy road; their voices,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rang through the quiet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,people.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The gate swung open and shut. William moved on the terrace; they had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"seen him. “Hallo, William!” And Bobby Kane, flapping his towel, began",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to leap and pirouette on the parched lawn. “Pity you didn’t come,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,William. The water was divine. And we all went to a little pub,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,afterwards and had sloe gin.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The others had reached the house. “I say, Isabel,” called Bobby, “would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you like me to wear my Nijinsky dress to-night?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” said Isabel, “nobody’s going to dress. We’re all starving.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"William’s starving, too. Come along, _mes amis_, let’s begin with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sardines.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ve found the sardines,” said Moira, and she ran into the hall,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,holding a box high in the air.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A Lady with a Box of Sardines,” said Dennis gravely.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, William, and how’s London?” asked Bill Hunt, drawing the cork",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out of a bottle of whisky.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, London’s not much changed,” answered William.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good old London,” said Bobby, very hearty, spearing a sardine.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But a moment later William was forgotten. Moira Morrison began,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wondering what colour one’s legs really were under water.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mine are the palest, palest mushroom colour.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Bill and Dennis ate enormously. And Isabel filled glasses, and changed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"plates, and found matches, smiling blissfully. At one moment, she said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I do wish, Bill, you’d paint it.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Paint what?” said Bill loudly, stuffing his mouth with bread.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Us,” said Isabel, “round the table. It would be so fascinating in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,twenty years’ time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Bill screwed up his eyes and chewed. “Light’s wrong,” he said rudely,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“far too much yellow”; and went on eating. And that seemed to charm,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Isabel, too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But after supper they were all so tired they could do nothing but yawn,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,until it was late enough to go to bed....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was not until William was waiting for his taxi the next afternoon,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that he found himself alone with Isabel. When he brought his suit-case,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"down into the hall, Isabel left the others and went over to him. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stooped down and picked up the suit-case. “What a weight!” she said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and she gave a little awkward laugh. “Let me carry it! To the gate.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, why should you?” said William. “Of course, not. Give it to me.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, please, do let me,” said Isabel. “I want to, really.” They walked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,together silently. William felt there was nothing to say now.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There,” said Isabel triumphantly, setting the suit-case down, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked anxiously along the sandy road. “I hardly seem to have seen you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"this time,” she said breathlessly. “It’s so short, isn’t it? I feel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you’ve only just come. Next time—” The taxi came into sight. “I hope,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they look after you properly in London. I’m so sorry the babies have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"been out all day, but Miss Neil had arranged it. They’ll hate missing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"you. Poor William, going back to London.” The taxi turned. “Good-bye!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She gave him a little hurried kiss; she was gone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fields, trees, hedges streamed by. They shook through the empty,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"blind-looking little town, ground up the steep pull to the station.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The train was in. William made straight for a first-class smoker, flung",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back into the corner, but this time he let the papers alone. He folded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his arms against the dull, persistent gnawing, and began in his mind to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,write a letter to Isabel.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The post was late as usual. They sat outside the house in long chairs,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,under coloured parasols. Only Bobby Kane lay on the turf at Isabel’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"feet. It was dull, stifling; the day drooped like a flag.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Do you think there will be Mondays in Heaven?” asked Bobby childishly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Dennis murmured, “Heaven will be one long Monday.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Isabel couldn’t help wondering what had happened to the salmon they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had for supper last night. She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,lunch and now....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Moira was asleep. Sleeping was her latest discovery. “It’s _so_,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wonderful. One simply shuts one’s eyes, that’s all. It’s _so_",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,delicious.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,When the old ruddy postman came beating along the sandy road on his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tricycle one felt the handle-bars ought to have been oars.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Bill Hunt put down his book. “Letters,” he said complacently, and they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all waited. But, heartless postman—O malignant world! There was only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"one, a fat one for Isabel. Not even a paper.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And mine’s only from William,” said Isabel mournfully.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“From William—already?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“He’s sending you back your marriage lines as a gentle reminder.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Does everybody have marriage lines? I thought they were only for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,servants.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Pages and pages! Look at her! A Lady reading a Letter,” said Dennis.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“_My darling, precious Isabel_.” Pages and pages there were. As Isabel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,read on her feeling of astonishment changed to a stifled feeling. What,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on earth had induced William...? How extraordinary it was.... What,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"could have made him...? She felt confused, more and more excited, even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"frightened. It was just like William. Was it? It was absurd, of course,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it must be absurd, ridiculous. “Ha, ha, ha! Oh dear!” What was she to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,do? Isabel flung back in her chair and laughed till she couldn’t stop,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,laughing.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do, do tell us,” said the others. “You must tell us.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m longing to,” gurgled Isabel. She sat up, gathered the letter, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"waved it at them. “Gather round,” she said. “Listen, it’s too",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,marvellous. A love-letter!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A love-letter! But how divine!” _Darling, precious Isabel._ But she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had hardly begun before their laughter interrupted her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Go on, Isabel, it’s perfect.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“It’s the most marvellous find.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, do go on, Isabel!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_God forbid, my darling, that I should be a drag on your happiness._",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh! oh! oh!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Sh! sh! sh!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And Isabel went on. When she reached the end they were hysterical:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Bobby rolled on the turf and almost sobbed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You must let me have it just as it is, entire, for my new book,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Dennis firmly. “I shall give it a whole chapter.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, Isabel,” moaned Moira, “that wonderful bit about holding you in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his arms!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I always thought those letters in divorce cases were made up. But they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pale before this.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Let me hold it. Let me read it, mine own self,” said Bobby Kane.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But, to their surprise, Isabel crushed the letter in her hand. She was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,laughing no longer. She glanced quickly at them all; she looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"exhausted. “No, not just now. Not just now,” she stammered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And before they could recover she had run into the house, through the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hall, up the stairs into her bedroom. Down she sat on the side of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bed. “How vile, odious, abominable, vulgar,” muttered Isabel. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pressed her eyes with her knuckles and rocked to and fro. And again she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"saw them, but not four, more like forty, laughing, sneering, jeering,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stretching out their hands while she read them William’s letter. Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,what a loathsome thing to have done. How could she have done it! _God,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"forbid, my darling, that I should be a drag on your happiness._",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,William! Isabel pressed her face into the pillow. But she felt that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even the grave bedroom knew her for what she was, shallow, tinkling,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,vain....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Presently from the garden below there came voices.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Isabel, we’re all going for a bathe. Do come!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come, thou wife of William!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Call her once before you go, call once yet!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Isabel sat up. Now was the moment, now she must decide. Would she go",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with them, or stay here and write to William. Which, which should it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"be? “I must make up my mind.” Oh, but how could there be any question?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Of course she would stay here and write.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Titania!” piped Moira.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“Isa-bel?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No, it was too difficult. “I’ll—I’ll go with them, and write to William",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"beautiful night, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"started to walk down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"faint wind blowing off the water ruffled under Fenella’s hat, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"put up her hand to keep it on. It was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the wool sheds, the cattle trucks, the cranes standing up so high, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little squat railway engine, all seemed carved out of solid darkness.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Here and there on a rounded wood-pile, that was like the stalk of a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"huge black mushroom, there hung a lantern, but it seemed afraid to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"unfurl its timid, quivering light in all that blackness; it burned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"softly, as if for itself.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fenella’s father pushed on with quick, nervous strides. Beside him her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster; they went so fast,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that she had now and again to give an undignified little skip to keep,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"up with them. As well as her luggage strapped into a neat sausage,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fenella carried clasped to her her grandma’s umbrella, and the handle,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"which was a swan’s head, kept giving her shoulder a sharp little peck",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as if it too wanted her to hurry.... Men, their caps pulled down, their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"collars turned up, swung by; a few women all muffled scurried along;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and one tiny boy, only his little black arms and legs showing out of a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"white woolly shawl, was jerked along angrily between his father and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mother; he looked like a baby fly that had fallen into the cream.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Then suddenly, so suddenly that Fenella and her grandma both leapt,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there sounded from behind the largest wool shed, that had a trail of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smoke hanging over it, “_Mia-oo-oo-O-O!_”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“First whistle,” said her father briefly, and at that moment they came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in sight of the Picton boat. Lying beside the dark wharf, all strung,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all beaded with round golden lights, the Picton boat looked as if she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was more ready to sail among stars than out into the cold sea. People,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pressed along the gangway. First went her grandma, then her father,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"then Fenella. There was a high step down on to the deck, and an old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sailor in a jersey standing by gave her his dry, hard hand. They were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there; they stepped out of the way of the hurrying people, and standing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,under a little iron stairway that led to the upper deck they began to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say good-bye.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There, mother, there’s your luggage!” said Fenella’s father, giving",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thank you, Frank.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, dear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“And your other tickets?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“That’s right.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He sounded stern, but Fenella, eagerly watching him, saw that he looked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tired and sad. “_Mia-oo-oo-O-O!_” The second whistle blared just above,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"their heads, and a voice like a cry shouted, “Any more for the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gangway?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’ll give my love to father,” Fenella saw her father’s lips say. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her grandma, very agitated, answered, “Of course I will, dear. Go now.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"You’ll be left. Go now, Frank. Go now.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s all right, mother. I’ve got another three minutes.” To her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,surprise Fenella saw her father take off his hat. He clasped grandma in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his arms and pressed her to him. “God bless you, mother!” she heard him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And grandma put her hand, with the black thread glove that was worn",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"through on her ring finger, against his cheek, and she sobbed, “God",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bless you, my own brave son!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"This was so awful that Fenella quickly turned her back on them,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"swallowed once, twice, and frowned terribly at a little green star on a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mast head. But she had to turn round again; her father was going.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good-bye, Fenella. Be a good girl.” His cold, wet moustache brushed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her cheek. But Fenella caught hold of the lapels of his coat.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How long am I going to stay?” she whispered anxiously. He wouldn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"look at her. He shook her off gently, and gently said, “We’ll see about",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that. Here! Where’s your hand?” He pressed something into her palm.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Here’s a shilling in case you should need it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A shilling! She must be going away for ever! “Father!” cried Fenella.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But he was gone. He was the last off the ship. The sailors put their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shoulders to the gangway. A huge coil of dark rope went flying through,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the air and fell “thump” on the wharf. A bell rang; a whistle shrilled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Silently the dark wharf began to slip, to slide, to edge away from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,them. Now there was a rush of water between. Fenella strained to see,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with all her might. “Was that father turning round?”—or waving?—or,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,standing alone?—or walking off by himself? The strip of water grew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"broader, darker. Now the Picton boat began to swing round steady,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pointing out to sea. It was no good looking any longer. There was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"nothing to be seen but a few lights, the face of the town clock hanging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in the air, and more lights, little patches of them, on the dark hills.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The freshening wind tugged at Fenella’s skirts; she went back to her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grandma. To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad. She had put the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"two sausages of luggage one on top of the other, and she was sitting on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them, her hands folded, her head a little on one side. There was an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"intent, bright look on her face. Then Fenella saw that her lips were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,moving and guessed that she was praying. But the old woman gave her a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bright nod as if to say the prayer was nearly over. She unclasped her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hands, sighed, clasped them again, bent forward, and at last gave",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,herself a soft shake.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And now, child,” she said, fingering the bow of her bonnet-strings, “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"think we ought to see about our cabins. Keep close to me, and mind you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t slip.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, grandma!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“And be careful the umbrellas aren’t caught in the stair rail. I saw a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, grandma.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Dark figures of men lounged against the rails. In the glow of their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pipes a nose shone out, or the peak of a cap, or a pair of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"surprised-looking eyebrows. Fenella glanced up. High in the air, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little figure, his hands thrust in his short jacket pockets, stood",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"staring out to sea. The ship rocked ever so little, and she thought the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stars rocked too. And now a pale steward in a linen coat, holding a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tray high in the palm of his hand, stepped out of a lighted doorway and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,skimmed past them. They went through that doorway. Carefully over the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,high brass-bound step on to the rubber mat and then down such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,terribly steep flight of stairs that grandma had to put both feet on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"each step, and Fenella clutched the clammy brass rail and forgot all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about the swan-necked umbrella.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At the bottom grandma stopped; Fenella was rather afraid she was going,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to pray again. But no, it was only to get out the cabin tickets. They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were in the saloon. It was glaring bright and stifling; the air smelled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of paint and burnt chop-bones and indiarubber. Fenella wished her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"grandma would go on, but the old woman was not to be hurried. An",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,immense basket of ham sandwiches caught her eye. She went up to them,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and touched the top one delicately with her finger.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How much are the sandwiches?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tuppence!” bawled a rude steward, slamming down a knife and fork.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Grandma could hardly believe it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Twopence _each_?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s right,” said the steward, and he winked at his companion.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Grandma made a small, astonished face. Then she whispered primly to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Fenella. “What wickedness!” And they sailed out at the further door and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,along a passage that had cabins on either side. Such a very nice,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stewardess came to meet them. She was dressed all in blue, and her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,collar and cuffs were fastened with large brass buttons. She seemed to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,know grandma well.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, Mrs. Crane,” said she, unlocking their washstand. “We’ve got you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,back again. It’s not often you give yourself a cabin.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” said grandma. “But this time my dear son’s thoughtfulness—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I hope—” began the stewardess. Then she turned round and took a long,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mournful look at grandma’s blackness and at Fenella’s black coat and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"skirt, black blouse, and hat with a crape rose.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Grandma nodded. “It was God’s will,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The stewardess shut her lips and, taking a deep breath, she seemed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,expand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What I always say is,” she said, as though it was her own discovery,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“sooner or later each of us has to go, and that’s a certingty.” She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"paused. “Now, can I bring you anything, Mrs Crane? A cup of tea? I know",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it’s no good offering you a little something to keep the cold out.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Grandma shook her head. “Nothing, thank you. We’ve got a few wine",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"biscuits, and Fenella has a very nice banana.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Then I’ll give you a look later on,” said the stewardess, and she went",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out, shutting the door.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What a very small cabin it was! It was like being shut up in a box with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grandma. The dark round eye above the washstand gleamed at them dully.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fenella felt shy. She stood against the door, still clasping her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,luggage and the umbrella. Were they going to get undressed in here?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Already her grandma had taken off her bonnet, and, rolling up the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"strings, she fixed each with a pin to the lining before she hung the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bonnet up. Her white hair shone like silk; the little bun at the back,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was covered with a black net. Fenella hardly ever saw her grandma with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her head uncovered; she looked strange.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I shall put on the woollen fascinator your dear mother crocheted for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"me,” said grandma, and, unstrapping the sausage, she took it out and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wound it round her head; the fringe of grey bobbles danced at her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eyebrows as she smiled tenderly and mournfully at Fenella. Then she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"undid her bodice, and something under that, and something else",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"underneath that. Then there seemed a short, sharp tussle, and grandma",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flushed faintly. Snip! Snap! She had undone her stays. She breathed a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sigh of relief, and sitting on the plush couch, she slowly and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,carefully pulled off her elastic-sided boots and stood them side by,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,side.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,By the time Fenella had taken off her coat and skirt and put on her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flannel dressing-gown grandma was quite ready.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Must I take off my boots, grandma? They’re lace.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Grandma gave them a moment’s deep consideration. “You’d feel a great,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"deal more comfortable if you did, child,” said she. She kissed Fenella.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Don’t forget to say your prayers. Our dear Lord is with us when we are,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at sea even more than when we are on dry land. And because I am an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"experienced traveller,” said grandma briskly, “I shall take the upper",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,berth.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, grandma, however will you get up there?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Three little spider-like steps were all Fenella saw. The old woman gave,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a small silent laugh before she mounted them nimbly, and she peered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,over the high bunk at the astonished Fenella.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You didn’t think your grandma could do that, did you?” said she. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as she sank back Fenella heard her light laugh again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The hard square of brown soap would not lather, and the water in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bottle was like a kind of blue jelly. How hard it was, too, to turn",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down those stiff sheets; you simply had to tear your way in. If,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everything had been different, Fenella might have got the giggles....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"At last she was inside, and while she lay there panting, there sounded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"from above a long, soft whispering, as though some one was gently,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gently rustling among tissue paper to find something. It was grandma,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,saying her prayers....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A long time passed. Then the stewardess came in; she trod softly and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leaned her hand on grandma’s bunk.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We’re just entering the Straits,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Oh!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s a fine night, but we’re rather empty. We may pitch a little.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And indeed at that moment the Picton Boat rose and rose and hung in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"air just long enough to give a shiver before she swung down again, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there was the sound of heavy water slapping against her sides. Fenella,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,remembered she had left the swan-necked umbrella standing up on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little couch. If it fell over, would it break? But grandma remembered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"too, at the same time.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I wonder if you’d mind, stewardess, laying down my umbrella,” she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,whispered.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not at all, Mrs. Crane.” And the stewardess, coming back to grandma,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"breathed, “Your little granddaughter’s in such a beautiful sleep.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“God be praised for that!” said grandma.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Poor little motherless mite!” said the stewardess. And grandma was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,still telling the stewardess all about what happened when Fenella fell,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,asleep.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But she hadn’t been asleep long enough to dream before she woke up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,again to see something waving in the air above her head. What was it?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,What could it be? It was a small grey foot. Now another joined it. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,seemed to be feeling about for something; there came a sigh.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m awake, grandma,” said Fenella.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, dear, am I near the ladder?” asked grandma. “I thought it was this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,end.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, grandma, it’s the other. I’ll put your foot on it. Are we there?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,asked Fenella.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“In the harbour,” said grandma. “We must get up, child. You’d better",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have a biscuit to steady yourself before you move.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Fenella had hopped out of her bunk. The lamp was still burning, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"night was over, and it was cold. Peering through that round eye she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could see far off some rocks. Now they were scattered over with foam;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,now a gull flipped by; and now there came a long piece of real land.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s land, grandma,” said Fenella, wonderingly, as though they had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,been at sea for weeks together. She hugged herself; she stood on one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leg and rubbed it with the toes of the other foot; she was trembling.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, it had all been so sad lately. Was it going to change? But all her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"grandma said was, “Make haste, child. I should leave your nice banana",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for the stewardess as you haven’t eaten it.” And Fenella put on her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,black clothes again and a button sprang off one of her gloves and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rolled to where she couldn’t reach it. They went up on deck.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But if it had been cold in the cabin, on deck it was like ice. The sun",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was not up yet, but the stars were dim, and the cold pale sky was the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,same colour as the cold pale sea. On the land a white mist rose and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fell. Now they could see quite plainly dark bush. Even the shapes of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the umbrella ferns showed, and those strange silvery withered trees",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that are like skeletons.... Now they could see the landing-stage and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"some little houses, pale too, clustered together, like shells on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lid of a box. The other passengers tramped up and down, but more slowly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"than they had the night before, and they looked gloomy.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And now the landing-stage came out to meet them. Slowly it swam towards,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the Picton boat, and a man holding a coil of rope, and a cart with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"small drooping horse and another man sitting on the step, came too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s Mr. Penreddy, Fenella, come for us,” said grandma. She sounded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pleased. Her white waxen cheeks were blue with cold, her chin trembled,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and she had to keep wiping her eyes and her little pink nose.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“You’ve got my—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, grandma.” Fenella showed it to her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The rope came flying through the air, and “smack” it fell on to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,deck. The gangway was lowered. Again Fenella followed her grandma on to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the wharf over to the little cart, and a moment later they were bowling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"away. The hooves of the little horse drummed over the wooden piles,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,then sank softly into the sandy road. Not a soul was to be seen; there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was not even a feather of smoke. The mist rose and fell and the sea,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,still sounded asleep as slowly it turned on the beach.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I seen Mr. Crane yestiddy,” said Mr. Penreddy. “He looked himself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,then. Missus knocked him up a batch of scones last week.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And now the little horse pulled up before one of the shell-like houses.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They got down. Fenella put her hand on the gate, and the big, trembling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dew-drops soaked through her glove-tips. Up a little path of round,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"white pebbles they went, with drenched sleeping flowers on either side.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Grandma’s delicate white picotees were so heavy with dew that they were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fallen, but their sweet smell was part of the cold morning. The blinds",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were down in the little house; they mounted the steps on to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"veranda. A pair of old bluchers was on one side of the door, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,large red watering-can on the other.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tut! tut! Your grandpa,” said grandma. She turned the handle. Not a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sound. She called, “Walter!” And immediately a deep voice that sounded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"half stifled called back, “Is that you, Mary?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Wait, dear,” said grandma. “Go in there.” She pushed Fenella gently",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,into a small dusky sitting-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"On the table a white cat, that had been folded up like a camel, rose,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stretched itself, yawned, and then sprang on to the tips of its toes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fenella buried one cold little hand in the white, warm fur, and smiled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,timidly while she stroked and listened to grandma’s gentle voice and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the rolling tones of grandpa.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"A door creaked. “Come in, dear.” The old woman beckoned, Fenella",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"followed. There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa. Just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his head with a white tuft and his rosy face and long silver beard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,showed over the quilt. He was like a very old wide-awake bird.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, my girl!” said grandpa. “Give us a kiss!” Fenella kissed him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Ugh!” said grandpa. “Her little nose is as cold as a button. What’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that she’s holding? Her grandma’s umbrella?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Fenella smiled again, and crooked the swan neck over the bed-rail.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Above the bed there was a big text in a deep black frame:—,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     Lost! One Golden Hour,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     No Reward Is Offered,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     For It Is Gone For Ever!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yer grandma painted that,” said grandpa. And he ruffled his white tuft",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and looked at Fenella so merrily she almost thought he winked at her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Miss Brill,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Although it was so brilliantly fine—the blue sky powdered with gold and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Publiques—Miss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur. The air,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was motionless, but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chill, like a chill from a glass of iced water before you sip, and now",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and again a leaf came drifting—from nowhere, from the sky. Miss Brill",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,put up her hand and touched her fur. Dear little thing! It was nice to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"feel it again. She had taken it out of its box that afternoon, shaken",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out the moth-powder, given it a good brush, and rubbed the life back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,into the dim little eyes. “What has been happening to me?” said the sad,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little eyes. Oh, how sweet it was to see them snap at her again from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the red eiderdown!... But the nose, which was of some black",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"composition, wasn’t at all firm. It must have had a knock, somehow.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Never mind—a little dab of black sealing-wax when the time came—when it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was absolutely necessary.... Little rogue! Yes, she really felt like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that about it. Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could have taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it. She felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a tingling in her hands and arms, but that came from walking, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"supposed. And when she breathed, something light and sad—no, not sad,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,exactly—something gentle seemed to move in her bosom.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Sunday. And the band sounded louder and gayer. That was because the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Season had begun. For although the band played all the year round on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Sundays, out of season it was never the same. It was like some one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,playing with only the family to listen; it didn’t care how it played if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there weren’t any strangers present. Wasn’t the conductor wearing a new,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"coat, too? She was sure it was new. He scraped with his foot and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flapped his arms like a rooster about to crow, and the bandsmen sitting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in the green rotunda blew out their cheeks and glared at the music. Now,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there came a little “flutey” bit—very pretty!—a little chain of bright,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drops. She was sure it would be repeated. It was; she lifted her head,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and smiled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Only two people shared her “special” seat: a fine old man in a velvet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"coat, his hands clasped over a huge carved walking-stick, and a big old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"woman, sitting upright, with a roll of knitting on her embroidered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"apron. They did not speak. This was disappointing, for Miss Brill",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,always looked forward to the conversation. She had become really quite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"expert, she thought, at listening as though she didn’t listen, at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sitting in other people’s lives just for a minute while they talked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,round her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She glanced, sideways, at the old couple. Perhaps they would go soon.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Last Sunday, too, hadn’t been as interesting as usual. An Englishman",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and his wife, he wearing a dreadful Panama hat and she button boots.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And she’d gone on the whole time about how she ought to wear,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,spectacles; she knew she needed them; but that it was no good getting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,any; they’d be sure to break and they’d never keep on. And he’d been so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"patient. He’d suggested everything—gold rims, the kind that curved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"round your ears, little pads inside the bridge. No, nothing would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,please her. “They’ll always be sliding down my nose!” Miss Brill had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wanted to shake her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The old people sat on the bench, still as statues. Never mind, there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was always the crowd to watch. To and fro, in front of the flower-beds",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and the band rotunda, the couples and groups paraded, stopped to talk,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to greet, to buy a handful of flowers from the old beggar who had his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tray fixed to the railings. Little children ran among them, swooping",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and laughing; little boys with big white silk bows under their chins,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little girls, little French dolls, dressed up in velvet and lace. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sometimes a tiny staggerer came suddenly rocking into the open from,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"under the trees, stopped, stared, as suddenly sat down “flop,” until",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"its small high-stepping mother, like a young hen, rushed scolding to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"its rescue. Other people sat on the benches and green chairs, but they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were nearly always the same, Sunday after Sunday, and—Miss Brill had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,often noticed—there was something funny about nearly all of them. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were odd, silent, nearly all old, and from the way they stared they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked as though they’d just come from dark little rooms or even—even,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cupboards!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Behind the rotunda the slender trees with yellow leaves down drooping,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and through them just a line of sea, and beyond the blue sky with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gold-veined clouds.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Tum-tum-tum tiddle-um! tiddle-um! tum tiddley-um tum ta! blew the band.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Two young girls in red came by and two young soldiers in blue met them,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and they laughed and paired and went off arm-in-arm. Two peasant women,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with funny straw hats passed, gravely, leading beautiful smoke-coloured",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"donkeys. A cold, pale nun hurried by. A beautiful woman came along and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dropped her bunch of violets, and a little boy ran after to hand them",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to her, and she took them and threw them away as if they’d been",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,poisoned. Dear me! Miss Brill didn’t know whether to admire that or,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not! And now an ermine toque and a gentleman in grey met just in front,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of her. He was tall, stiff, dignified, and she was wearing the ermine",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"toque she’d bought when her hair was yellow. Now everything, her hair,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her face, even her eyes, was the same colour as the shabby ermine, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her hand, in its cleaned glove, lifted to dab her lips, was a tiny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"yellowish paw. Oh, she was so pleased to see him—delighted! She rather",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought they were going to meet that afternoon. She described where,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she’d been—everywhere, here, there, along by the sea. The day was so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"charming—didn’t he agree? And wouldn’t he, perhaps?... But he shook his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"head, lighted a cigarette, slowly breathed a great deep puff into her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"face, and even while she was still talking and laughing, flicked the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,match away and walked on. The ermine toque was alone; she smiled more,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brightly than ever. But even the band seemed to know what she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"feeling and played more softly, played tenderly, and the drum beat,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“The Brute! The Brute!” over and over. What would she do? What was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"going to happen now? But as Miss Brill wondered, the ermine toque",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"turned, raised her hand as though she’d seen some one else, much nicer,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"just over there, and pattered away. And the band changed again and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"played more quickly, more gayly than ever, and the old couple on Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Brill’s seat got up and marched away, and such a funny old man with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,long whiskers hobbled along in time to the music and was nearly knocked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,over by four girls walking abreast.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, how fascinating it was! How she enjoyed it! How she loved sitting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"here, watching it all! It was like a play. It was exactly like a play.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Who could believe the sky at the back wasn’t painted? But it wasn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"till a little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like a little “theatre” dog, a little dog that had been drugged, that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Miss Brill discovered what it was that made it so exciting. They were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all on the stage. They weren’t only the audience, not only looking on;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they were acting. Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,somebody would have noticed if she hadn’t been there; she was part of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the performance after all. How strange she’d never thought of it like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that before! And yet it explained why she made such a point of starting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,from home at just the same time each week—so as not to be late for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"performance—and it also explained why she had quite a queer, shy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,feeling at telling her English pupils how she spent her Sunday,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,afternoons. No wonder! Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud. She was on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the stage. She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the newspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"had got quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow, the hollowed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eyes, the open mouth and the high pinched nose. If he’d been dead she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mightn’t have noticed for weeks; she wouldn’t have minded. But suddenly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he knew he was having the paper read to him by an actress! “An,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,actress!” The old head lifted; two points of light quivered in the old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eyes. “An actress—are ye?” And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"though it were the manuscript of her part and said gently; “Yes, I have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,been an actress for a long time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The band had been having a rest. Now they started again. And what they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"played was warm, sunny, yet there was just a faint chill—a something,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what was it?—not sadness—no, not sadness—a something that made you want",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to sing. The tune lifted, lifted, the light shone; and it seemed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Miss Brill that in another moment all of them, all the whole company,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"would begin singing. The young ones, the laughing ones who were moving",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"together, they would begin, and the men’s voices, very resolute and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"brave, would join them. And then she too, she too, and the others on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the benches—they would come in with a kind of accompaniment—something,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"low, that scarcely rose or fell, something so beautiful—moving.... And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Miss Brill’s eyes filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other members of the company. Yes, we understand, we understand, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought—though what they understood she didn’t know.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Just at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,couple had been. They were beautifully dressed; they were in love. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hero and heroine, of course, just arrived from his father’s yacht. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"still soundlessly singing, still with that trembling smile, Miss Brill",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,prepared to listen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, not now,” said the girl. “Not here, I can’t.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But why? Because of that stupid old thing at the end there?” asked the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,boy. “Why does she come here at all—who wants her? Why doesn’t she keep,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her silly old mug at home?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s her fu-fur which is so funny,” giggled the girl. “It’s exactly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like a fried whiting.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ah, be off with you!” said the boy in an angry whisper. Then: “Tell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"me, ma petite chère—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, not here,” said the girl. “Not _yet_.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,On her way home she usually bought a slice of honey-cake at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,baker’s. It was her Sunday treat. Sometimes there was an almond in her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"slice, sometimes not. It made a great difference. If there was an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,almond it was like carrying home a tiny present—a surprise—something,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that might very well not have been there. She hurried on the almond,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Sundays and struck the match for the kettle in quite a dashing way.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But to-day she passed the baker’s by, climbed the stairs, went into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little dark room—her room like a cupboard—and sat down on the red,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,eiderdown. She sat there for a long time. The box that the fur came out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of was on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"looking, laid it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,heard something crying.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Her First Ball,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Exactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Perhaps her first real partner was the cab. It did not matter that she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shared the cab with the Sheridan girls and their brother. She sat back,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in her own little corner of it, and the bolster on which her hand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rested felt like the sleeve of an unknown young man’s dress suit; and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"away they bowled, past waltzing lamp-posts and houses and fences and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,trees.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Have you really never been to a ball before, Leila? But, my child, how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,too weird—” cried the Sheridan girls.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Our nearest neighbour was fifteen miles,” said Leila softly, gently",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,opening and shutting her fan.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh dear, how hard it was to be indifferent like the others! She tried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not to smile too much; she tried not to care. But every single thing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was so new and exciting... Meg’s tuberoses, Jose’s long loop of amber,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Laura’s little dark head, pushing above her white fur like a flower",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through snow. She would remember for ever. It even gave her a pang to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,see her cousin Laurie throw away the wisps of tissue paper he pulled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,from the fastenings of his new gloves. She would like to have kept,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"those wisps as a keepsake, as a remembrance. Laurie leaned forward and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,put his hand on Laura’s knee.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Look here, darling,” he said. “The third and the ninth as usual.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Twig?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, how marvellous to have a brother! In her excitement Leila felt that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"if there had been time, if it hadn’t been impossible, she couldn’t have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"helped crying because she was an only child, and no brother had ever",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"said “Twig?” to her; no sister would ever say, as Meg said to Jose that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"moment, “I’ve never known your hair go up more successfully than it has",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to-night!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But, of course, there was no time. They were at the drill hall already;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there were cabs in front of them and cabs behind. The road was bright,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on either side with moving fan-like lights, and on the pavement gay",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,couples seemed to float through the air; little satin shoes chased each,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,other like birds.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hold on to me, Leila; you’ll get lost,” said Laura.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come on, girls, let’s make a dash for it,” said Laurie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Leila put two fingers on Laura’s pink velvet cloak, and they were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"somehow lifted past the big golden lantern, carried along the passage,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and pushed into the little room marked “Ladies.” Here the crowd was so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,great there was hardly space to take off their things; the noise was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,deafening. Two benches on either side were stacked high with wraps. Two,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,old women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,everybody was pressing forward trying to get at the little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dressing-table and mirror at the far end.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,A great quivering jet of gas lighted the ladies’ room. It couldn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wait; it was dancing already. When the door opened again and there came,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a burst of tuning from the drill hall, it leaped almost to the ceiling.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Dark girls, fair girls were patting their hair, tying ribbons again,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tucking handkerchiefs down the fronts of their bodices, smoothing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,marble-white gloves. And because they were all laughing it seemed to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Leila that they were all lovely.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Aren’t there any invisible hair-pins?” cried a voice. “How most,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,extraordinary! I can’t see a single invisible hair-pin.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Powder my back, there’s a darling,” cried some one else.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But I must have a needle and cotton. I’ve torn simply miles and miles,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of the frill,” wailed a third.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Then, “Pass them along, pass them along!” The straw basket of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,programmes was tossed from arm to arm. Darling little pink-and-silver,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"programmes, with pink pencils and fluffy tassels. Leila’s fingers shook",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as she took one out of the basket. She wanted to ask some one, “Am I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"meant to have one too?” but she had just time to read: “Waltz 3. _Two,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Two in a Canoe._ Polka 4. _Making the Feathers Fly_,” when Meg cried,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ready, Leila?” and they pressed their way through the crush in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,passage towards the big double doors of the drill hall.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Dancing had not begun yet, but the band had stopped tuning, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,noise was so great it seemed that when it did begin to play it would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"never be heard. Leila, pressing close to Meg, looking over Meg’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shoulder, felt that even the little quivering coloured flags strung",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,across the ceiling were talking. She quite forgot to be shy; she forgot,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,how in the middle of dressing she had sat down on the bed with one shoe,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,off and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring up her cousins and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say she couldn’t go after all. And the rush of longing she had had to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"be sitting on the veranda of their forsaken up-country home, listening",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to the baby owls crying “More pork” in the moonlight, was changed to a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rush of joy so sweet that it was hard to bear alone. She clutched her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fan, and, gazing at the gleaming, golden floor, the azaleas, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lanterns, the stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the band in a corner, she thought breathlessly, “How heavenly; how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,simply heavenly!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,towards the stage.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"partners; she’s under my wing,” said Meg, going up to one girl after",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,another.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Strange faces smiled at Leila—sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"answered, “Of course, my dear.” But Leila felt the girls didn’t really",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,see her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn’t the men begin?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"What were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. “May I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have the pleasure?” He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"an eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"freckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man—fat, with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a big bald patch on his head—took her programme and murmured, “Let me",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"see, let me see!” And he was a long time comparing his programme, which",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"trouble that Leila was ashamed. “Oh, please don’t bother,” she said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,at her again. “Do I remember this bright little face?” he said softly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Is it known to me of yore?” At that moment the band began playing; the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"couples, scattering them, sending them spinning....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,where Miss Eccles (of London) held her “select” classes. But the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,difference between that dusty-smelling hall—with calico texts on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"rabbit’s ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls’",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,feet with her long white wand—and this was so tremendous that Leila was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sure if her partner didn’t come and she had to listen to that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"marvellous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fly out of one of those dark windows that showed the stars.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ours, I think—” Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hadn’t to die after all. Some one’s hand pressed her waist, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Quite a good floor, isn’t it?” drawled a faint voice close to her ear.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I think it’s most beautifully slippery,” said Leila.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Pardon!” The faint voice sounded surprised. Leila said it again. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"there was a tiny pause before the voice echoed, “Oh, quite!” and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was swung round again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He steered so beautifully. That was the great difference between,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dancing with girls and men, Leila decided. Girls banged into each",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other, and stamped on each other’s feet; the girl who was gentleman",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,always clutched you so.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The azaleas were separate flowers no longer; they were pink and white,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,flags streaming by.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Were you at the Bells’ last week?” the voice came again. It sounded,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tired. Leila wondered whether she ought to ask him if he would like to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stop.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, this is my first dance,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Her partner gave a little gasping laugh. “Oh, I say,” he protested.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, it is really the first dance I’ve ever been to.” Leila was most",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fervent. It was such a relief to be able to tell somebody. “You see,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I’ve lived in the country all my life up till now....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"At that moment the music stopped, and they went to sit on two chairs",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,against the wall. Leila tucked her pink satin feet under and fanned,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"herself, while she blissfully watched the other couples passing and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,disappearing through the swing doors.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Enjoying yourself, Leila?” asked Jose, nodding her golden head.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Laura passed and gave her the faintest little wink; it made Leila,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wonder for a moment whether she was quite grown up after all. Certainly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her partner did not say very much. He coughed, tucked his handkerchief",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"away, pulled down his waistcoat, took a minute thread off his sleeve.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But it didn’t matter. Almost immediately the band started and her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,second partner seemed to spring from the ceiling.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Floor’s not bad,” said the new voice. Did one always begin with the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"floor? And then, “Were you at the Neaves’ on Tuesday?” And again Leila",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,explained. Perhaps it was a little strange that her partners were not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,more interested. For it was thrilling. Her first ball! She was only at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the beginning of everything. It seemed to her that she had never known,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what the night was like before. Up till now it had been dark, silent,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beautiful very often—oh yes—but mournful somehow. Solemn. And now it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would never be like that again—it had opened dazzling bright.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Care for an ice?” said her partner. And they went through the swing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"doors, down the passage, to the supper room. Her cheeks burned, she was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fearfully thirsty. How sweet the ices looked on little glass plates and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"how cold the frosted spoon was, iced too! And when they came back to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the hall there was the fat man waiting for her by the door. It gave her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quite a shock again to see how old he was; he ought to have been on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stage with the fathers and mothers. And when Leila compared him with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her other partners he looked shabby. His waistcoat was creased, there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was a button off his glove, his coat looked as if it was dusty with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,French chalk.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Come along, little lady,” said the fat man. He scarcely troubled to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"clasp her, and they moved away so gently, it was more like walking than",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dancing. But he said not a word about the floor. “Your first dance,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,isn’t it?” he murmured.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How _did_ you know?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ah,” said the fat man, “that’s what it is to be old!” He wheezed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"faintly as he steered her past an awkward couple. “You see, I’ve been",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,doing this kind of thing for the last thirty years.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Thirty years?” cried Leila. Twelve years before she was born!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It hardly bears thinking about, does it?” said the fat man gloomily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Leila looked at his bald head, and she felt quite sorry for him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I think it’s marvellous to be still going on,” she said kindly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Kind little lady,” said the fat man, and he pressed her a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"closer, and hummed a bar of the waltz. “Of course,” he said, “you can’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hope to last anything like as long as that. No-o,” said the fat man,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“long before that you’ll be sitting up there on the stage, looking on,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in your nice black velvet. And these pretty arms will have turned into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little short fat ones, and you’ll beat time with such a different kind",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of fan—a black bony one.” The fat man seemed to shudder. “And you’ll,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"smile away like the poor old dears up there, and point to your",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"daughter, and tell the elderly lady next to you how some dreadful man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tried to kiss her at the club ball. And your heart will ache, ache”—the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fat man squeezed her closer still, as if he really was sorry for that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,poor heart—“because no one wants to kiss you now. And you’ll say how,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"unpleasant these polished floors are to walk on, how dangerous they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"are. Eh, Mademoiselle Twinkletoes?” said the fat man softly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Leila gave a light little laugh, but she did not feel like laughing.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Was it—could it all be true? It sounded terribly true. Was this first,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ball only the beginning of her last ball, after all? At that the music",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"seemed to change; it sounded sad, sad; it rose upon a great sigh. Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,how quickly things changed! Why didn’t happiness last for ever? For,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ever wasn’t a bit too long.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I want to stop,” she said in a breathless voice. The fat man led her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to the door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” she said, “I won’t go outside. I won’t sit down. I’ll just stand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"here, thank you.” She leaned against the wall, tapping with her foot,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pulling up her gloves and trying to smile. But deep inside her a little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,girl threw her pinafore over her head and sobbed. Why had he spoiled it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,all?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I say, you know,” said the fat man, “you mustn’t take me seriously,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little lady.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“As if I should!” said Leila, tossing her small dark head and sucking",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her underlip....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Again the couples paraded. The swing doors opened and shut. Now new,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,music was given out by the bandmaster. But Leila didn’t want to dance,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"any more. She wanted to be home, or sitting on the veranda listening to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"those baby owls. When she looked through the dark windows at the stars,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they had long beams like wings....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But presently a soft, melting, ravishing tune began, and a young man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with curly hair bowed before her. She would have to dance, out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"politeness, until she could find Meg. Very stiffly she walked into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,middle; very haughtily she put her hand on his sleeve. But in one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"minute, in one turn, her feet glided, glided. The lights, the azaleas,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the dresses, the pink faces, the velvet chairs, all became one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beautiful flying wheel. And when her next partner bumped her into the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fat man and he said, “Par_don_,” she smiled at him more radiantly than",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ever. She didn’t even recognize him again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"from running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fluttered by; from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"voices; a bell rang; a voice like a bird cried, “Muriel.” And then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,there came from the staircase a tremendous knock-knock-knocking. Some,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,one had dropped her dumbbells.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The Science Mistress stopped Miss Meadows.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Miss Meadows, hugging the knife, stared in hatred at the Science",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mistress. Everything about her was sweet, pale, like honey. You would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not have been surprised to see a bee caught in the tangles of that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,yellow hair.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,mocking light in them. (Had she noticed anything?),The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, not quite as bad as that,” said Miss Meadows, and she gave the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Science Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a quick grimace and passed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Forms Four, Five, and Six were assembled in the music hall. The noise",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was deafening. On the platform, by the piano, stood Mary Beazley, Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Meadows’ favourite, who played accompaniments. She was turning the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"music stool. When she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud, warning “Sh-sh!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girls!” and Miss Meadows, her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"under her arm, strode down the centre aisle, mounted the steps, turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sharply, seized the brass music stand, planted it in front of her, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gave two sharp taps with her baton for silence.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Silence, please! Immediately!” and, looking at nobody, her glance",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"swept over that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with bobbing pink",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"faces and hands, quivering butterfly hair-bows, and music-books",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,outspread. She knew perfectly well what they were thinking. “Meady is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"in a wax.” Well, let them think it! Her eyelids quivered; she tossed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her head, defying them. What could the thoughts of those creatures",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"matter to some one who stood there bleeding to death, pierced to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"heart, to the heart, by such a letter—",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,... “I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,mistake. Not that I do not love you. I love you as much as it is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"possible for me to love any woman, but, truth to tell, I have come to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the conclusion that I am not a marrying man, and the idea of settling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down fills me with nothing but—” and the word “disgust” was scratched,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out lightly and “regret” written over the top.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Basil! Miss Meadows stalked over to the piano. And Mary Beazley, who",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was waiting for this moment, bent forward; her curls fell over her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cheeks while she breathed, “Good morning, Miss Meadows,” and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,motioned towards rather than handed to her mistress a beautiful yellow,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,chrysanthemum. This little ritual of the flower had been gone through,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"for ages and ages, quite a term and a half. It was as much part of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lesson as opening the piano. But this morning, instead of taking it up,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"instead of tucking it into her belt while she leant over Mary and said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thank you, Mary. How very nice! Turn to page thirty-two,” what was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mary’s horror when Miss Meadows totally ignored the chrysanthemum, made",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"no reply to her greeting, but said in a voice of ice, “Page fourteen,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"please, and mark the accents well.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Staggering moment! Mary blushed until the tears stood in her eyes, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Miss Meadows was gone back to the music stand; her voice rang through,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the music hall.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Page fourteen. We will begin with page fourteen. ‘A Lament.’ Now,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girls, you ought to know it by this time. We shall take it all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"together; not in parts, all together. And without expression. Sing it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"though, quite simply, beating time with the left hand.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She raised the baton; she tapped the music stand twice. Down came Mary,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"on the opening chord; down came all those left hands, beating the air,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and in chimed those young, mournful voices:—",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     Fast! Ah, too Fast Fade the Ro-o-ses of Pleasure;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     Soon Autumn yields unto Wi-i-nter Drear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Mu-u-sic’s Gay Measure",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     Passes away from the Listening Ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Good Heavens, what could be more tragic than that lament! Every note",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was a sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness. Miss Meadows lifted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her arms in the wide gown and began conducting with both hands. “... I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she beat. And the voices cried: _Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly._ What could have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,possessed him to write such a letter! What could have led up to it! It,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,came out of nothing. His last letter had been all about a fumed-oak,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bookcase he had bought for “our” books, and a “natty little hall-stand”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he had seen, “a very neat affair with a carved owl on a bracket,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,holding three hat-brushes in its claws.” How she had smiled at that! So,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like a man to think one needed three hat-brushes! _From the Listening,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ear_, sang the voices.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Once again,” said Miss Meadows. “But this time in parts. Still without",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"expression.” _Fast! Ah, too Fast._ With the gloom of the contraltos",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"added, one could scarcely help shuddering. _Fade the Roses of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Pleasure._ Last time he had come to see her, Basil had worn a rose in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his buttonhole. How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with that dark red rose! And he knew it, too. He couldn’t help knowing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it. First he stroked his hair, then his moustache; his teeth gleamed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,when he smiled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“The headmaster’s wife keeps on asking me to dinner. It’s a perfect,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But can’t you refuse?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, well, it doesn’t do for a man in my position to be unpopular.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_Music’s Gay Measure_, wailed the voices. The willow trees, outside the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"high, narrow windows, waved in the wind. They had lost half their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,leaves. The tiny ones that clung wriggled like fishes caught on a line.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“... I am not a marrying man....” The voices were silent; the piano,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,waited.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Quite good,” said Miss Meadows, but still in such a strange, stony",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tone that the younger girls began to feel positively frightened. “But,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"now that we know it, we shall take it with expression. As much",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"expression as you can put into it. Think of the words, girls. Use your",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"imaginations. _Fast! Ah, too Fast_,” cried Miss Meadows. “That ought to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"break out—a loud, strong _forte_—a lament. And then in the second line,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_Winter Drear_, make that _Drear_ sound as if a cold wind were blowing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"through it. _Dre-ear!_” said she so awfully that Mary Beazley, on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"music stool, wriggled her spine. “The third line should be one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"crescendo. _Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Music’s Gay Measure._ Breaking on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"first word of the last line, _Passes._ And then on the word, _Away_,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you must begin to die... to fade... until _The Listening Ear_ is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,nothing more than a faint whisper.... You can slow down as much as you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like almost on the last line. Now, please.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Again the two light taps; she lifted her arms again. _Fast! Ah, too",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Fast._ “... and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,disgust—” Disgust was what he had written. That was as good as to say,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,their engagement was definitely broken off. Broken off! Their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,engagement! People had been surprised enough that she had got engaged.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The Science Mistress would not believe it at first. But nobody had been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,as surprised as she. She was thirty. Basil was twenty-five. It had been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a miracle, simply a miracle, to hear him say, as they walked home from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"church that very dark night, “You know, somehow or other, I’ve got fond",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of you.” And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,_Passes away from the Listening Ear._,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Repeat! Repeat!” said Miss Meadows. “More expression, girls! Once",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,more!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_Fast! Ah, too Fast._ The older girls were crimson; some of the younger",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ones began to cry. Big spots of rain blew against the windows, and one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"could hear the willows whispering, “... not that I do not love you....”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, my darling, if you love me,” thought Miss Meadows, “I don’t mind",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,how much it is. Love me as little as you like.” But she knew he didn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"love her. Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word “disgust,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,so that she couldn’t read it! _Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear._,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She would have to leave the school, too. She could never face the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,to whisper... to vanish....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Suddenly the door opened. A little girl in blue walked fussily up the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"aisle, hanging her head, biting her lips, and twisting the silver",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bangle on her red little wrist. She came up the steps and stood before,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, Monica, what is it?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, if you please, Miss Meadows,” said the little girl, gasping, “Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Wyatt wants to see you in the mistress’s room.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Very well,” said Miss Meadows. And she called to the girls, “I shall",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,put you on your honour to talk quietly while I am away.” But they were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,too subdued to do anything else. Most of them were blowing their noses.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The corridors were silent and cold; they echoed to Miss Meadows’ steps.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The head mistress sat at her desk. For a moment she did not look up.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She was as usual disentangling her eyeglasses, which had got caught in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her lace tie. “Sit down, Miss Meadows,” she said very kindly. And then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she picked up a pink envelope from the blotting-pad. “I sent for you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,just now because this telegram has come for you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“A telegram for me, Miss Wyatt?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Basil! He had committed suicide, decided Miss Meadows. Her hand flew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out, but Miss Wyatt held the telegram back a moment. “I hope it’s not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bad news,” she said, so more than kindly. And Miss Meadows tore it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,open.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Pay no attention to letter, must have been mad, bought hat-stand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,forward.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,” blushed Miss Meadows. “It’s nothing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bad at all. It’s”—and she gave an apologetic little laugh—“it’s from my,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_fiancé_ saying that... saying that—” There was a pause. “I _see_,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,said Miss Wyatt. And another pause. Then—“You’ve fifteen minutes more,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of your class, Miss Meadows, haven’t you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, Miss Wyatt.” She got up. She half ran towards the door.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,” said Miss Wyatt. “I must say I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,don’t approve of my teachers having telegrams sent to them in school,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hours, unless in case of very bad news, such as death,” explained Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Wyatt, “or a very serious accident, or something to that effect. Good",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"news, Miss Meadows, will always keep, you know.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"On the wings of hope, of love, of joy, Miss Meadows sped back to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"music hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the piano.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Page thirty-two, Mary,” she said, “page thirty-two,” and, picking up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her lips to hide her smile.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Then she turned to the girls, rapped with her baton: “Page thirty-two,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,girls. Page thirty-two.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     We come here To-day with Flowers o’erladen,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"     With Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,     To-oo Congratulate . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Stop! Stop!” cried Miss Meadows. “This is awful. This is dreadful.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And she beamed at her girls. “What’s the matter with you all? Think,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girls, think of what you’re singing. Use your imaginations. _With",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Flowers o’erladen. Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot._ And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"_Congratulate._” Miss Meadows broke off. “Don’t look so doleful, girls.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It ought to sound warm, joyful, eager. _Congratulate._ Once more.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Quickly. All together. Now then!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And this time Miss Meadows’ voice sounded over all the other,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"voices—full, deep, glowing with expression.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The Stranger,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"move again. There she lay, immense, motionless on the grey crinkled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"water, a loop of smoke above her, an immense flock of gulls screaming",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and diving after the galley droppings at the stern. You could just see,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little couples parading—little flies walking up and down the dish on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the grey crinkled tablecloth. Other flies clustered and swarmed at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,edge. Now there was a gleam of white on the lower deck—the cook’s apron,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,or the stewardess perhaps. Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on to the bridge.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"In the front of the crowd a strong-looking, middle-aged man, dressed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"very well, very snugly in a grey overcoat, grey silk scarf, thick",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gloves and dark felt hat, marched up and down, twirling his folded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,umbrella. He seemed to be the leader of the little crowd on the wharf,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and at the same time to keep them together. He was something between,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the sheep-dog and the shepherd.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But what a fool—what a fool he had been not to bring any glasses! There,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wasn’t a pair of glasses between the whole lot of them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Curious thing, Mr. Scott, that none of us thought of glasses. We might",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have been able to stir ’em up a bit. We might have managed a little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,signalling. _Don’t hesitate to land. Natives harmless._ Or: _A welcome,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,awaits you. All is forgiven._ What? Eh?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mr. Hammond’s quick, eager glance, so nervous and yet so friendly and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"confiding, took in everybody on the wharf, roped in even those old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"chaps lounging against the gangways. They knew, every man-jack of them,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that Mrs. Hammond was on that boat, and that he was so tremendously",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,excited it never entered his head not to believe that this marvellous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fact meant something to them too. It warmed his heart towards them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They were, he decided, as decent a crowd of people—— Those old chaps",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over by the gangways, too—fine, solid old chaps. What chests—by Jove!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And he squared his own, plunged his thick-gloved hands into his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pockets, rocked from heel to toe.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, my wife’s been in Europe for the last ten months. On a visit to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"our eldest girl, who was married last year. I brought her up here, as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"far as Salisbury, myself. So I thought I’d better come and fetch her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back. Yes, yes, yes.” The shrewd grey eyes narrowed again and searched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"anxiously, quickly, the motionless liner. Again his overcoat was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"unbuttoned. Out came the thin, butter-yellow watch again, and for the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,twentieth—fiftieth—hundredth time he made the calculation.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Let me see now. It was two fifteen when the doctor’s launch went off.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Two fifteen. It is now exactly twenty-eight minutes past four. That is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to say, the doctor’s been gone two hours and thirteen minutes. Two",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hours and thirteen minutes! Whee-ooh!” He gave a queer little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,half-whistle and snapped his watch to again. “But I think we should,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"have been told if there was anything up—don’t you, Mr. Gaven?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, yes, Mr. Hammond! I don’t think there’s anything to—anything to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"worry about,” said Mr. Gaven, knocking out his pipe against the heel of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his shoe. “At the same time—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Quite so! Quite so!” cried Mr. Hammond. “Dashed annoying!” He paced,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,quickly up and down and came back again to his stand between Mr. and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mrs. Scott and Mr. Gaven. “It’s getting quite dark, too,” and he waved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his folded umbrella as though the dusk at least might have had the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"decency to keep off for a bit. But the dusk came slowly, spreading like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a slow stain over the water. Little Jean Scott dragged at her mother’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I wan’ my tea, mammy!” she wailed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I expect you do,” said Mr. Hammond. “I expect all these ladies want",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"their tea.” And his kind, flushed, almost pitiful glance roped them all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in again. He wondered whether Janey was having a final cup of tea in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the saloon out there. He hoped so; he thought not. It would be just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like her not to leave the deck. In that case perhaps the deck steward,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would bring her up a cup. If he’d been there he’d have got it for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her—somehow. And for a moment he was on deck, standing over her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"watching her little hand fold round the cup in the way she had, while",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she drank the only cup of tea to be got on board.... But now he was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"back here, and the Lord only knew when that cursed Captain would stop",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hanging about in the stream. He took another turn, up and down, up and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,down. He walked as far as the cab-stand to make sure his driver hadn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,disappeared; back he swerved again to the little flock huddled in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shelter of the banana crates. Little Jean Scott was still wanting her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,tea. Poor little beggar! He wished he had a bit of chocolate on him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, Jean!” he said. “Like a lift up?” And easily, gently, he swung",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the little girl on to a higher barrel. The movement of holding her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"steadying her, relieved him wonderfully, lightened his heart.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hold on,” he said, keeping an arm round her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, don’t worry about _Jean_, Mr. Hammond!” said Mrs. Scott.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s all right, Mrs. Scott. No trouble. It’s a pleasure. Jean’s a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little pal of mine, aren’t you, Jean?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, Mr. Hammond,” said Jean, and she ran her finger down the dent of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his felt hat.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But suddenly she caught him by the ear and gave a loud scream. “Lo-ok,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mr. Hammond! She’s moving! Look, she’s coming in!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"By Jove! So she was. At last! She was slowly, slowly turning round. A",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bell sounded far over the water and a great spout of steam gushed into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the air. The gulls rose; they fluttered away like bits of white paper.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And whether that deep throbbing was her engines or his heart Mr.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hammond couldn’t say. He had to nerve himself to bear it, whatever it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was. At that moment old Captain Johnson, the harbour-master, came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"striding down the wharf, a leather portfolio under his arm.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Jean’ll be all right,” said Mr. Scott. “I’ll hold her.” He was just in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,time. Mr. Hammond had forgotten about Jean. He sprang away to greet old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Captain Johnson.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, Captain,” the eager, nervous voice rang out again, “you’ve taken",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pity on us at last.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“It’s no good blaming me, Mr. Hammond,” wheezed old Captain Johnson,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"staring at the liner. “You got Mrs. Hammond on board, ain’t yer?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, yes!” said Hammond, and he kept by the harbour-master’s side.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Mrs. Hammond’s there. Hul-lo! We shan’t be long now!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"With her telephone ring-ringing, the thrum of her screw filling the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"air, the big liner bore down on them, cutting sharp through the dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,water so that big white shavings curled to either side. Hammond and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,harbour-master kept in front of the rest. Hammond took off his hat; he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,raked the decks—they were crammed with passengers; he waved his hat and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"bawled a loud, strange “Hul-lo!” across the water; and then turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,round and burst out laughing and said something—nothing—to old Captain,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Johnson.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Seen her?” asked the harbour-master.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, not yet. Steady—wait a bit!” And suddenly, between two great",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,clumsy idiots—“Get out of the way there!” he signed with his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,umbrella—he saw a hand raised—a white glove shaking a handkerchief.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Another moment, and—thank God, thank God!—there she was. There was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Janey. There was Mrs. Hammond, yes, yes, yes—standing by the rail and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,smiling and nodding and waving her handkerchief.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well that’s first class—first class! Well, well, well!” He positively",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stamped. Like lightning he drew out his cigar-case and offered it to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"old Captain Johnson. “Have a cigar, Captain! They’re pretty good. Have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a couple! Here”—and he pressed all the cigars in the case on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,harbour-master—“I’ve a couple of boxes up at the hotel.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Thenks, Mr. Hammond!” wheezed old Captain Johnson.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Hammond stuffed the cigar-case back. His hands were shaking, but he’d",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"got hold of himself again. He was able to face Janey. There she was,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"leaning on the rail, talking to some woman and at the same time",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"watching him, ready for him. It struck him, as the gulf of water",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"closed, how small she looked on that huge ship. His heart was wrung",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with such a spasm that he could have cried out. How little she looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to have come all that long way and back by herself! Just like her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,though. Just like Janey. She had the courage of a—— And now the crew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had come forward and parted the passengers; they had lowered the rails,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for the gangways.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The voices on shore and the voices on board flew to greet each other.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“All well?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“All well.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“How’s mother?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Much better.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hullo, Jean!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Hillo, Aun’ Emily!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Had a good voyage?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Splendid!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Shan’t be long now!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Not long now.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The engines stopped. Slowly she edged to the wharf-side.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Make way there—make way—make way!” And the wharf hands brought the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,heavy gangways along at a sweeping run. Hammond signed to Janey to stay,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,where she was. The old harbour-master stepped forward; he followed. As,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to “ladies first,” or any rot like that, it never entered his head.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“After you, Captain!” he cried genially. And, treading on the old man’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"heels, he strode up the gangway on to the deck in a bee-line to Janey,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and Janey was clasped in his arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, well, well! Yes, yes! Here we are at last!” he stammered. It was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all he could say. And Janey emerged, and her cool little voice—the only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"voice in the world for him—said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, darling! Have you been waiting long?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No; not long. Or, at any rate, it didn’t matter. It was over now. But",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the point was, he had a cab waiting at the end of the wharf. Was she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ready to go off. Was her luggage ready? In that case they could cut off,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,sharp with her cabin luggage and let the rest go hang until to-morrow.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,He bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was just the same. Not a day changed. Just as he’d always known her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She laid her small hand on his sleeve.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“How are the children, John?” she asked.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,(Hang the children!) “Perfectly well. Never better in their lives.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Haven’t they sent me letters?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, yes—of course! I’ve left them at the hotel for you to digest",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,later on.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We can’t go quite so fast,” said she. “I’ve got people to say good-bye",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to—and then there’s the Captain.” As his face fell she gave his arm a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,small understanding squeeze. “If the Captain comes off the bridge I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,want you to thank him for having looked after your wife so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"beautifully.” Well, he’d got her. If she wanted another ten minutes—As",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he gave way she was surrounded. The whole first-class seemed to want to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,say good-bye to Janey.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Good-bye, _dear_ Mrs. Hammond! And next time you’re in Sydney I’ll",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,_expect_ you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Darling Mrs. Hammond! You won’t forget to write to me, will you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, Mrs. Hammond, what this boat would have been without you!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It was as plain as a pikestaff that she was by far the most popular,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,woman on board. And she took it all—just as usual. Absolutely composed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Just her little self—just Janey all over; standing there with her veil,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thrown back. Hammond never noticed what his wife had on. It was all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,same to him whatever she wore. But to-day he did notice that she wore a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"black “costume”—didn’t they call it?—with white frills, trimmings he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"supposed they were, at the neck and sleeves. All this while Janey",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,handed him round.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“John, dear!” And then: “I want to introduce you to—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Finally they did escape, and she led the way to her state-room. To",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,follow Janey down the passage that she knew so well—that was so strange,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to him; to part the green curtains after her and to step into the cabin,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that had been hers gave him exquisite happiness. But—confound it!—the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"stewardess was there on the floor, strapping up the rugs.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s the last, Mrs. Hammond,” said the stewardess, rising and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pulling down her cuffs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"He was introduced again, and then Janey and the stewardess disappeared",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,into the passage. He heard whisperings. She was getting the tipping,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"business over, he supposed. He sat down on the striped sofa and took",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,his hat off. There were the rugs she had taken with her; they looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"good as new. All her luggage looked fresh, perfect. The labels were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,written in her beautiful little clear hand—“Mrs. John Hammond.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Mrs. John Hammond!” He gave a long sigh of content and leaned back,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,crossing his arms. The strain was over. He felt he could have sat there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for ever sighing his relief—the relief at being rid of that horrible,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tug, pull, grip on his heart. The danger was over. That was the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,feeling. They were on dry land again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But at that moment Janey’s head came round the corner.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Darling—do you mind? I just want to go and say good-bye to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,doctor.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hammond started up. “I’ll come with you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, no!” she said. “Don’t bother. I’d rather not. I’ll not be a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,minute.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And before he could answer she was gone. He had half a mind to run,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,after her; but instead he sat down again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Would she really not be long? What was the time now? Out came the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"watch; he stared at nothing. That was rather queer of Janey, wasn’t it?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Why couldn’t she have told the stewardess to say good-bye for her? Why,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,did she have to go chasing after the ship’s doctor? She could have sent,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a note from the hotel even if the affair had been urgent. Urgent? Did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it—could it mean that she had been ill on the voyage—she was keeping,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,something from him? That was it! He seized his hat. He was going off to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,find that fellow and to wring the truth out of him at all costs. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought he’d noticed just something. She was just a touch too calm—too,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,steady. From the very first moment—,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The curtains rang. Janey was back. He jumped to his feet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Janey, have you been ill on this voyage? You have!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ill?” Her airy little voice mocked him. She stepped over the rugs, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"came up close, touched his breast, and looked up at him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Darling,” she said, “don’t frighten me. Of course I haven’t! Whatever",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,makes you think I have? Do I look ill?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But Hammond didn’t see her. He only felt that she was looking at him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and that there was no need to worry about anything. She was here to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,look after things. It was all right. Everything was.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The gentle pressure of her hand was so calming that he put his over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hers to hold it there. And she said:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Stand still. I want to look at you. I haven’t seen you yet. You’ve had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"your beard beautifully trimmed, and you look—younger, I think, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,decidedly thinner! Bachelor life agrees with you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Agrees with me!” He groaned for love and caught her close again. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"again, as always, he had the feeling that he was holding something that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"never was quite his—his. Something too delicate, too precious, that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would fly away once he let go.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“For God’s sake let’s get off to the hotel so that we can be by,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ourselves!” And he rang the bell hard for some one to look sharp with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the luggage.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Walking down the wharf together she took his arm. He had her on his arm,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,again. And the difference it made to get into the cab after Janey—to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,throw the red-and-yellow striped blanket round them both—to tell the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,driver to hurry because neither of them had had any tea. No more going,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"without his tea or pouring out his own. She was back. He turned to her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"squeezed her hand, and said gently, teasingly, in the “special” voice",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he had for her: “Glad to be home again, dearie?” She smiled; she didn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even bother to answer, but gently she drew his hand away as they came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to the brighter streets.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“We’ve got the best room in the hotel,” he said. “I wouldn’t be put off",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with another. And I asked the chambermaid to put in a bit of a fire in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"case you felt chilly. She’s a nice, attentive girl. And I thought now",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"we were here we wouldn’t bother to go home to-morrow, but spend the day",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looking round and leave the morning after. Does that suit you? There’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"no hurry, is there? The children will have you soon enough.... I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thought a day’s sight-seeing might make a nice break in your,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"journey—eh, Janey?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Have you taken the tickets for the day after?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“I should think I have!” He unbuttoned his overcoat and took out his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bulging pocket-book. “Here we are! I reserved a first-class carriage to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Cooktown. There it is—‘Mr. _and_ Mrs. John Hammond.’ I thought we might,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"as well do ourselves comfortably, and we don’t want other people",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"butting in, do we? But if you’d like to stop here a bit longer—?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, no!” said Janey quickly. “Not for the world! The day after",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to-morrow, then. And the children—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But they had reached the hotel. The manager was standing in the broad,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,brilliantly-lighted porch. He came down to greet them. A porter ran,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,from the hall for their boxes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well, Mr. Arnold, here’s Mrs. Hammond at last!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The manager led them through the hall himself and pressed the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,elevator-bell. Hammond knew there were business pals of his sitting at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the little hall tables having a drink before dinner. But he wasn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,going to risk interruption; he looked neither to the right nor the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"left. They could think what they pleased. If they didn’t understand,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the more fools they—and he stepped out of the lift, unlocked the door",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of their room, and shepherded Janey in. The door shut. Now, at last,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they were alone together. He turned up the light. The curtains were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drawn; the fire blazed. He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,towards her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But—would you believe it!—again they were interrupted. This time it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the porter with the luggage. He made two journeys of it, leaving the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"door open in between, taking his time, whistling through his teeth in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the corridor. Hammond paced up and down the room, tearing off his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gloves, tearing off his scarf. Finally he flung his overcoat on to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bedside.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,At last the fool was gone. The door clicked. Now they _were_ alone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Said Hammond: “I feel I’ll never have you to myself again. These cursed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"people! Janey”—and he bent his flushed, eager gaze upon her—“let’s have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dinner up here. If we go down to the restaurant we’ll be interrupted,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and then there’s the confounded music” (the music he’d praised so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"highly, applauded so loudly last night!). “We shan’t be able to hear",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,each other speak. Let’s have something up here in front of the fire.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"It’s too late for tea. I’ll order a little supper, shall I? How does",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,that idea strike you?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Do, darling!” said Janey. “And while you’re away—the children’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,letters—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, later on will do!” said Hammond.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But then we’d get it over,” said Janey. “And I’d first have time to—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, I needn’t go down!” explained Hammond. “I’ll just ring and give",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the order... you don’t want to send me away, do you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Janey shook her head and smiled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But you’re thinking of something else. You’re worrying about,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something,” said Hammond. “What is it? Come and sit here—come and sit",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on my knee before the fire.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’ll just unpin my hat,” said Janey, and she went over to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dressing-table. “A-ah!” She gave a little cry.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What is it?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Nothing, darling. I’ve just found the children’s letters. That’s all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"right! They will keep. No hurry now!” She turned to him, clasping them.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"She tucked them into her frilled blouse. She cried quickly, gaily: “Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,how typical this dressing-table is of you!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Why? What’s the matter with it?” said Hammond.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“If it were floating in eternity I should say ‘John!’” laughed Janey,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"staring at the big bottle of hair tonic, the wicker bottle of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"eau-de-Cologne, the two hair-brushes, and a dozen new collars tied with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pink tape. “Is this all your luggage?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Hang my luggage!” said Hammond; but all the same he liked being,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,laughed at by Janey. “Let’s talk. Let’s get down to things. Tell,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,me”—and as Janey perched on his knees he leaned back and drew her into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the deep, ugly chair—“tell me you’re really glad to be back, Janey.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, darling, I am glad,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But just as when he embraced her he felt she would fly away, so Hammond",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,never knew—never knew for dead certain that she was as glad as he was.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,How could he know? Would he ever know? Would he always have this,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"craving—this pang like hunger, somehow, to make Janey so much part of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,him that there wasn’t any of her to escape? He wanted to blot out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everybody, everything. He wished now he’d turned off the light. That",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,might have brought her nearer. And now those letters from the children,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rustled in her blouse. He could have chucked them into the fire.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Janey,” he whispered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, dear?” She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely. Their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,breathing rose and fell together.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Janey!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What is it?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Turn to me,” he whispered. A slow, deep flush flowed into his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"forehead. “Kiss me, Janey! You kiss me!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It seemed to him there was a tiny pause—but long enough for him to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"suffer torture—before her lips touched his, firmly, lightly—kissing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"them as she always kissed him, as though the kiss—how could he describe",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it?—confirmed what they were saying, signed the contract. But that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wasn’t what he wanted; that wasn’t at all what he thirsted for. He felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"suddenly, horrible tired.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“If you knew,” he said, opening his eyes, “what it’s been like—waiting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to-day. I thought the boat never would come in. There we were, hanging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,about. What kept you so long?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,She made no answer. She was looking away from him at the fire. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flames hurried—hurried over the coals, flickered, fell.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Not asleep, are you?” said Hammond, and he jumped her up and down.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No,” she said. And then: “Don’t do that, dear. No, I was thinking. As",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"a matter of fact,” she said, “one of the passengers died last night—a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"man. That’s what held us up. We brought him in—I mean, he wasn’t buried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"at sea. So, of course, the ship’s doctor and the shore doctor—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What was it?” asked Hammond uneasily. He hated to hear of death. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hated this to have happened. It was, in some queer way, as though he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,and Janey had met a funeral on their way to the hotel.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, it wasn’t anything in the least infectious!” said Janey. She was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,speaking scarcely above her breath. “It was _heart_.” A pause. “Poor,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fellow!” she said. “Quite young.” And she watched the fire flicker and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"fall. “He died in my arms,” said Janey.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The blow was so sudden that Hammond thought he would faint. He couldn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,move; he couldn’t breathe. He felt all his strength flowing—flowing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"into the big dark chair, and the big dark chair held him fast, gripped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"him, forced him to bear it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“What?” he said dully. “What’s that you say?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“The end was quite peaceful,” said the small voice. “He just”—and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Hammond saw her lift her gentle hand—“breathed his life away at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,end.” And her hand fell.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Who—else was there?” Hammond managed to ask.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Nobody. I was alone with him.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ah, my God, what was she saying! What was she doing to him! This would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,kill him! And all the while she spoke:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I saw the change coming and I sent the steward for the doctor, but the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"doctor was too late. He couldn’t have done anything, anyway.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But—why _you_, why _you_?” moaned Hammond.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"At that Janey turned quickly, quickly searched his face.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You don’t _mind_, John, do you?” she asked. “You don’t—It’s nothing to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,do with you and me.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Somehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her. Somehow,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"or other he stammered: “No—go—on, go on! I want you to tell me.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But, John darling—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Tell me, Janey!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There’s nothing to tell,” she said, wondering. “He was one of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,first-class passengers. I saw he was very ill when he came on board....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,But he seemed to be so much better until yesterday. He had a severe,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"attack in the afternoon—excitement—nervousness, I think, about",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,arriving. And after that he never recovered.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But why didn’t the stewardess—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, my dear—the stewardess!” said Janey. “What would he have felt? And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,besides... he might have wanted to leave a message... to—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Didn’t he?” muttered Hammond. “Didn’t he say anything?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, darling, not a word!” She shook her head softly. “All the time I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was with him he was too weak... he was too weak even to move a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,finger....”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Janey was silent. But her words, so light, so soft, so chill, seemed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hover in the air, to rain into his breast like snow.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,The fire had gone red. Now it fell in with a sharp sound and the room,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was colder. Cold crept up his arms. The room was huge, immense,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"glittering. It filled his whole world. There was the great blind bed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,with his coat flung across it like some headless man saying his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"prayers. There was the luggage, ready to be carried away again,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"anywhere, tossed into trains, carted on to boats.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,... “He was too weak. He was too weak to move a finger.” And yet he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,died in Janey’s arms. She—who’d never—never once in all these,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,years—never on one single solitary occasion—,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"No; he mustn’t think of it. Madness lay in thinking of it. No, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wouldn’t face it. He couldn’t stand it. It was too much to bear!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And now Janey touched his tie with her fingers. She pinched the edges,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of the tie together.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’re not—sorry I told you, John darling? It hasn’t made you sad? It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring—warm, eager,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"restless—was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"of everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his arm. And he couldn’t meet her, no; he couldn’t square up once more",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"late sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over. Quite suddenly he hadn’t the energy, he hadn’t the heart to stand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, “Be off with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,you!” Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual—tipping his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wide-awake with his stick—all the people whom he knew, the friends,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, “I’m a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,match and more for any of you”—that old Mr. Neave could not manage at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,happened. Harold hadn’t come back from lunch until close on four. Where,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had he been? What had he been up to? He wasn’t going to let his father,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"know. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"good-bye to a caller, when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"usual, cool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile that women",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,found so fascinating.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"trouble all along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"such lips; it was uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"servants, it was not too much to say they made a young god of him; they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"worshipped Harold, they forgave him everything; and he had needed some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,forgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his mother’s purse, taken the money, and hidden the purse in the cook’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"edge. But it wasn’t only his family who spoiled Harold, he reflected,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it was everybody; he had only to look and to smile, and down they went",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,before him. So perhaps it wasn’t to be wondered at that he expected the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"office to carry on the tradition. H’m, h’m! But it couldn’t be done. No",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"business—not even a successful, established, big paying concern—could",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,be played with. A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it, or it went all to pieces before his eyes....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thing over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,himself. Enjoying himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ancient cabbage palms outside the Government buildings! Enjoying,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,himself! The wind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"cackle. Sitting at home, twiddling his thumbs, conscious all the while",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that his life’s work was slipping away, dissolving, disappearing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"through Harold’s fine fingers, while Harold smiled....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There’s absolutely no need",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,people persist in saying how tired you’re looking. Here’s this huge,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,change. Or you could take up some hobby.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,reads about or sees on the stage.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Perhaps so....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,here. There are girls—”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her rocker.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,frill.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Is that you, father?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,immense drawing-room chairs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cabs about at that time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But Marion wouldn’t be stopped. “No, mother, you spoil father, and it’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,not right. You ought to be stricter with him. He’s very naughty.” She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"laughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Strange! When she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"voice; she had even stuttered, and now, whatever she said—even if it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was only “Jam, please, father”—it rang out as though she were on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,stage.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?” asked Charlotte,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,beginning to rock again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m not sure,” said Old Mr. Neave. “I’m not sure. I didn’t see him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,after four o’clock.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“He said—” began Charlotte.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"paper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There, you see,” she cried. “That’s what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,touches of silver. Don’t you agree?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Give it to me, love,” said Charlotte. She fumbled for her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"tortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"with her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. “Very sweet!” she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. “But I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,shouldn’t have the train.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Not the train!” wailed Ethel tragically. “But the train’s the whole,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,point.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Here, mother, let me decide.” Marion snatched the paper playfully from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Charlotte. “I agree with mother,” she cried triumphantly. “The train",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,overweights it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Old Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,he was tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were too much for him to-night. They were too... too.... But all his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drowsing brain could think of was—too _rich_ for him. And somewhere at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the back of everything he was watching a little withered ancient man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,climbing up endless flights of stairs. Who was he?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I shan’t dress to-night,” he muttered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“What do you say, father?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Eh, what, what?” Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,"“But, father, we’ve got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,“You needn’t make any effort. What is Charles _for_?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“But if you’re really not up to it,” Charlotte wavered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,“Very well! Very well!” Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,little old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to take the pin out of his tie.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,spectacle case.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"like a spider’s—thin, withered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"was he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"spider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Old Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"shone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,time. He’d been forgotten. What had all this to do with him—this house,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"and Charlotte, the girls and Harold—what did he know about them? They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were strangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,wife. His wife!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sorrowful, mournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"round his neck. A face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"breathed, “Good-bye, my treasure.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"My treasure! “Good-bye, my treasure!” Which of them had spoken? Why had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. _She_ was his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dream.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Then the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"hands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, “Dinner is on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"table, sir!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“I’m coming, I’m coming,” said old Mr. Neave.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,The Lady’s Maid,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over, I thought, perhaps....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,out!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"her hair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,to one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Those pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, “Now, if only the pansies",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was there no one could tell the difference.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Only the last year, madam. Only after she’d got a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little—well—feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was—she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"thought she’d lost something. She couldn’t keep still, she couldn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"settle. All day long she’d be up and down, up and down; you’d meet her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"everywhere,—on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she’d look up at you, and she’d say—just like a child, “I’ve lost it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I’ve lost it.” “Come along,” I’d say, “come along, and I’ll lay out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,your patience for you.” But she’d catch me by the hand—I was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"favourite of hers—and whisper, “Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Sad, wasn’t it?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"words she ever said was—very slow, “Look in—the—Look—in—” And then she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,was gone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... No, madam, I can’t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"see, it’s like this, I’ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,a hair-dresser’s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"table dressing my doll’s hair—copying the assistants, I suppose. They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"latest fashions and all. And there I’d sit all day, quiet as quiet—the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,customers never knew. Only now and again I’d take my peep from under,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the table-cloth.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and—would you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"believe it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,like the little monkey I was. Grandfather was _furious_! He caught hold,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,of the tongs—I shall never forget it—grabbed me by the hand and shut my,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fingers in them. “That’ll teach you!” he said. It was a fearful burn.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,I’ve got the mark of it to-day.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Well, you see, madam, he’d taken such pride in my hair. He used to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"something beautiful—big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"took the penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,fright I’d made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what I did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out, I don’t know how far I didn’t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sight, with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,People must have laughed when they saw me....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn’t bear the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"sight of me after. Couldn’t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"aunt took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,on the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her I met my lady....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don’t remember",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"ever feeling—well—a child, as you might say. You see there was my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"uniform, and one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,cuffs from the first. Oh yes—once I did! That was—funny! It was like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,this. My lady had her two little nieces staying with her—we were at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,Sheldon at the time—and there was a fair on the common.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Now, Ellen,” she said, “I want you to take the two young ladies for a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,ride on the donkeys.” Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,were the first I’d seen out of a cart—for pleasure as you might say.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"girls—older than me, even—were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"common, I don’t mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don’t know",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"what it was, but the way the little feet went, and the eyes—so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,gentle—and the soft ears—made me want to go on a donkey more than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,anything in the world!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... Of course, I couldn’t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it was donkeys—donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,if I didn’t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"to bed—I was sleeping in Mrs. James’s bedroom, our cook that was, at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"the time—as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"madam, would you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"be asleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"could, “_I do want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!_” You",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"see, I had to say it, and I thought they wouldn’t laugh at me if they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,knew I was only dreaming. Artful—wasn’t it? Just what a silly child,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,would think....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,it wasn’t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,across from where we was living. Funny—wasn’t it? And me such a one for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"flowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"out of the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,(his name was Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"arranged—and that began it. Flowers! you wouldn’t believe it, madam,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,the flowers he used to bring me. He’d stop at nothing. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"lilies-of-the-valley more than once, and I’m not exaggerating! Well, of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"course, we were going to be married and live over the shop, and it was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all going to be just so, and I was to have the window to arrange....",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Oh, how I’ve done that window of a Saturday! Not really, of course,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"madam, just dreaming, as you might say. I’ve done it for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"Christmas—motto in holly, and all—and I’ve had my Easter lilies with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"gorgeous star all daffodils in the middle. I’ve hung—well, that’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,enough of that. The day came he was to call for me to choose the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,furniture. Shall I ever forget it? It was a Tuesday. My lady wasn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"quite herself that afternoon. Not that she’d said anything, of course;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,she never does or will. But I knew by the way that she kept wrapping,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,herself up and asking me if it was cold—and her little nose looked...,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,pinched. I didn’t like leaving her; I knew I’d be worrying all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"time. At last I asked her if she’d rather I put it off. “Oh no, Ellen,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she said, “you mustn’t mind about me. You mustn’t disappoint your young",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"man.” And so cheerful, you know, madam, never thinking about herself.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,It made me feel worse than ever. I began to wonder... then she dropped,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,her handkerchief and began to stoop down to pick it up herself—a thing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"she never did. “Whatever are you doing!” I cried, running to stop her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“Well,” she said, smiling, you know, madam, “I shall have to begin to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"practise.” Oh, it was all I could do not to burst out crying. I went",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"over to the dressing-table and made believe to rub up the silver, and I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"couldn’t keep myself in, and I asked her if she’d rather I... didn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"get married. “No, Ellen,” she said—that was her voice, madam, like I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"giving you—“No, Ellen, not for the _wide world_!” But while she said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"it, madam—I was looking in her glass; of course, she didn’t know I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,could see her—she put her little hand on her heart just like her dear,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, _madam_!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,saw me....,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
1429,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

1429,won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,1,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was not an inch of room for Lottie and Kezia in the buggy. When,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Pat swung them on top of the luggage they wobbled; the grandmother’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lap was full and Linda Burnell could not possibly have held a lump of a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"child on hers for any distance. Isabel, very superior, was perched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"beside the new handy-man on the driver’s seat. Hold-alls, bags and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,boxes were piled upon the floor. “These are absolute necessities that I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"will not let out of my sight for one instant,” said Linda Burnell, her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,voice trembling with fatigue and excitement.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Lottie and Kezia stood on the patch of lawn just inside the gate all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ready for the fray in their coats with brass anchor buttons and little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"round caps with battleship ribbons. Hand in hand, they stared with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round solemn eyes first at the absolute necessities and then at their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mother.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“We shall simply have to leave them. That is all. We shall simply have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to cast them off,” said Linda Burnell. A strange little laugh flew from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her lips; she leaned back against the buttoned leather cushions and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shut her eyes, her lips trembling with laughter. Happily at that moment",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Mrs. Samuel Josephs, who had been watching the scene from behind her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"drawing-room blind, waddled down the garden path.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Why nod leave the chudren with be for the afterdoon, Brs. Burnell?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They could go on the dray with the storeban when he comes in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"eveding. Those thigs on the path have to go, dod’t they?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, everything outside the house is supposed to go,” said Linda",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Burnell, and she waved a white hand at the tables and chairs standing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,on their heads on the front lawn. How absurd they looked! Either they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ought to be the other way up, or Lottie and Kezia ought to stand on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"their heads, too. And she longed to say: “Stand on your heads,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"children, and wait for the store-man.” It seemed to her that would be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,so exquisitely funny that she could not attend to Mrs. Samuel Josephs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The fat creaking body leaned across the gate, and the big jelly of a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"face smiled. “Dod’t you worry, Brs. Burnell. Loddie and Kezia can have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tea with by chudren in the dursery, and I’ll see theb on the dray",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,afterwards.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The grandmother considered. “Yes, it really is quite the best plan. We",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"are very obliged to you, Mrs. Samuel Josephs. Children, say ‘thank you’",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to Mrs. Samuel Josephs.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Two subdued chirrups: “Thank you, Mrs. Samuel Josephs.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“And be good little girls, and—come closer—” they advanced, “don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forget to tell Mrs. Samuel Josephs when you want to. . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, granma.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Dod’t worry, Brs. Burnell.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,At the last moment Kezia let go Lottie’s hand and darted towards the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,buggy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I want to kiss my granma good-bye again.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But she was too late. The buggy rolled off up the road, Isabel bursting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with pride, her nose turned up at all the world, Linda Burnell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"prostrated, and the grandmother rummaging among the very curious",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"oddments she had had put in her black silk reticule at the last moment,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,for something to give her daughter. The buggy twinkled away in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sunlight and fine golden dust up the hill and over. Kezia bit her lip,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"but Lottie, carefully finding her handkerchief first, set up a wail.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Mother! Granma!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Mrs. Samuel Josephs, like a huge warm black silk tea cosy, enveloped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s all right, by dear. Be a brave child. You come and blay in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dursery!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She put her arm round weeping Lottie and led her away. Kezia followed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"making a face at Mrs. Samuel Josephs’ placket, which was undone as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"usual, with two long pink corset laces hanging out of it. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Lottie’s weeping died down as she mounted the stairs, but the sight of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her at the nursery door with swollen eyes and a blob of a nose gave,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"great satisfaction to the S. J.’s, who sat on two benches before a long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,table covered with American cloth and set out with immense plates of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bread and dripping and two brown jugs that faintly steamed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Hullo! You’ve been crying!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Ooh! Your eyes have gone right in.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Doesn’t her nose look funny.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“You’re all red-and-patchy.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Lottie was quite a success. She felt it and swelled, smiling timidly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Go and sit by Zaidee, ducky,” said Mrs. Samuel Josephs, “and Kezia,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you sid ad the end by Boses.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Moses grinned and gave her a nip as she sat down; but she pretended not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to notice. She did hate boys.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Which will you have?” asked Stanley, leaning across the table very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"politely, and smiling at her. “Which will you have to begin",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with—strawberries and cream or bread and dripping?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Strawberries and cream, please,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Ah-h-h-h.” How they all laughed and beat the table with their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,teaspoons. Wasn’t that a take in! Wasn’t it now! Didn’t he fox her!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Good old Stan!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Ma! She thought it was real.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Even Mrs. Samuel Josephs, pouring out the milk and water, could not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"help smiling. “You bustn’t tease theb on their last day,” she wheezed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But Kezia bit a big piece out of her bread and dripping, and then stood",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the piece up on her plate. With the bite out it made a dear little sort,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of a gate. Pooh! She didn’t care! A tear rolled down her cheek, but she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wasn’t crying. She couldn’t have cried in front of those awful Samuel,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Josephs. She sat with her head bent, and as the tear dripped slowly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"down, she caught it with a neat little whisk of her tongue and ate it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before any of them had seen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,2,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,After tea Kezia wandered back to their own house. Slowly she walked up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the back steps, and through the scullery into the kitchen. Nothing was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,left in it but a lump of gritty yellow soap in one corner of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kitchen window sill and a piece of flannel stained with a blue bag in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,another. The fireplace was choked up with rubbish. She poked among it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,but found nothing except a hair-tidy with a heart painted on it that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"had belonged to the servant girl. Even that she left lying, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,trailed through the narrow passage into the drawing-room. The Venetian,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blind was pulled down but not drawn close. Long pencil rays of sunlight,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shone through and the wavy shadow of a bush outside danced on the gold,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lines. Now it was still, now it began to flutter again, and now it came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,almost as far as her feet. Zoom! Zoom! a blue-bottle knocked against,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the ceiling; the carpet-tacks had little bits of red fluff sticking to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The dining-room window had a square of coloured glass at each corner.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,One was blue and one was yellow. Kezia bent down to have one more look,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"at a blue lawn with blue arum lilies growing at the gate, and then at a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,yellow lawn with yellow lilies and a yellow fence. As she looked a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little Chinese Lottie came out on to the lawn and began to dust the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tables and chairs with a corner of her pinafore. Was that really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Lottie? Kezia was not quite sure until she had looked through the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ordinary window.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Upstairs in her father’s and mother’s room she found a pill box black,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and shiny outside and red in, holding a blob of cotton wool.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I could keep a bird’s egg in that,” she decided.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,In the servant girl’s room there was a stay-button stuck in a crack of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the floor, and in another crack some beads and a long needle. She knew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,there was nothing in her grandmother’s room; she had watched her pack.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She went over to the window and leaned against it, pressing her hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,against the pane.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Kezia liked to stand so before the window. She liked the feeling of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cold shining glass against her hot palms, and she liked to watch the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,funny white tops that came on her fingers when she pressed them hard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"against the pane. As she stood there, the day flickered out and dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,came. With the dark crept the wind snuffling and howling. The windows,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of the empty house shook, a creaking came from the walls and floors, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,piece of loose iron on the roof banged forlornly. Kezia was suddenly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"quite, quite still, with wide open eyes and knees pressed together. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was frightened. She wanted to call Lottie and to go on calling all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,while she ran downstairs and out of the house. But IT was just behind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her, waiting at the door, at the head of the stairs, at the bottom of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the stairs, hiding in the passage, ready to dart out at the back door.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But Lottie was at the back door, too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Kezia!” she called cheerfully. “The storeman’s here. Everything is on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the dray and three horses, Kezia. Mrs. Samuel Josephs has given us a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"big shawl to wear round us, and she says to button up your coat. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,won’t come out because of asthma.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Lottie was very important.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Now then, you kids,” called the storeman. He hooked his big thumbs",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,under their arms and up they swung. Lottie arranged the shawl “most,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,beautifully” and the storeman tucked up their feet in a piece of old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blanket.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Lift up. Easy does it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They might have been a couple of young ponies. The storeman felt over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the cords holding his load, unhooked the brakechain from the wheel, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"whistling, he swung up beside them.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Keep close to me,” said Lottie, “because otherwise you pull the shawl",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"away from my side, Kezia.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But Kezia edged up to the storeman. He towered beside her big as a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,giant and he smelled of nuts and new wooden boxes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,3,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was the first time that Lottie and Kezia had ever been out so late.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Everything looked different—the painted wooden houses far smaller than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"they did by day, the gardens far bigger and wilder. Bright stars",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,speckled the sky and the moon hung over the harbour dabbling the waves,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with gold. They could see the lighthouse shining on Quarantine Island,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and the green lights on the old coal hulks.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“There comes the Picton boat,” said the storeman, pointing to a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,steamer all hung with bright beads.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But when they reached the top of the hill and began to go down the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"other side the harbour disappeared, and although they were still in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,town they were quite lost. Other carts rattled past. Everybody knew the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,storeman.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Night, Fred.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Night O,” he shouted.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Kezia liked very much to hear him. Whenever a cart appeared in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,distance she looked up and waited for his voice. He was an old friend;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and she and her grandmother had often been to his place to buy grapes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The storeman lived alone in a cottage that had a glasshouse against one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wall built by himself. All the glasshouse was spanned and arched over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with one beautiful vine. He took her brown basket from her, lined it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with three large leaves, and then he felt in his belt for a little horn",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"knife, reached up and snapped off a big blue cluster and laid it on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,leaves so tenderly that Kezia held her breath to watch. He was a very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"big man. He wore brown velvet trousers, and he had a long brown beard.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But he never wore a collar, not even on Sunday. The back of his neck",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was burnt bright red.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Where are we now?” Every few minutes one of the children asked him the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,question.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Why, this is Hawk Street, or Charlotte Crescent.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Of course it is,” Lottie pricked up her ears at the last name; she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,always felt that Charlotte Crescent belonged specially to her. Very few,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,people had streets with the same name as theirs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Look, Kezia, there is Charlotte Crescent. Doesn’t it look different?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Now everything familiar was left behind. Now the big dray rattled into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"unknown country, along new roads with high clay banks on either side,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"up steep, steep hills, down into bushy valleys, through wide shallow",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"rivers. Further and further. Lottie’s head wagged; she drooped, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,slipped half into Kezia’s lap and lay there. But Kezia could not open,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her eyes wide enough. The wind blew and she shivered; but her cheeks,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and ears burned.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Do stars ever blow about?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not to notice,” said the storeman.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“We’ve got a nuncle and a naunt living near our new house,” said Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“They have got two children, Pip, the eldest is called, and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,youngest’s name is Rags. He’s got a ram. He has to feed it with a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nenamuel teapot and a glove top over the spout. He’s going to show us.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What is the difference between a ram and a sheep?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, a ram has horns and runs for you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Kezia considered. “I don’t want to see it frightfully,” she said. “I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hate rushing animals like dogs and parrots. I often dream that animals,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"rush at me—even camels—and while they are rushing, their heads swell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,e-enormous.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The storeman said nothing. Kezia peered up at him, screwing up her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,eyes. Then she put her finger out and stroked his sleeve; it felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hairy. “Are we near?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not far off, now,” answered the storeman. “Getting tired?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, I’m not an atom bit sleepy,” said Kezia. “But my eyes keep",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"curling up in such a funny sort of way.” She gave a long sigh, and to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stop her eyes from curling she shut them. . . . When she opened them,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again they were clanking through a drive that cut through the garden,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"like a whip lash, looping suddenly an island of green, and behind the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"island, but out of sight until you came upon it, was the house. It was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"long and low built, with a pillared verandah and balcony all the way",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round. The soft white bulk of it lay stretched upon the green garden,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,like a sleeping beast. And now one and now another of the windows,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,leaped into light. Someone was walking through the empty rooms carrying,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a lamp. From a window downstairs the light of a fire flickered. A,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,strange beautiful excitement seemed to stream from the house in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,quivering ripples.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Where are we?” said Lottie, sitting up. Her reefer cap was all on one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,side and on her cheek there was the print of an anchor button she had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pressed against while sleeping. Tenderly the storeman lifted her, set",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her cap straight, and pulled down her crumpled clothes. She stood",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blinking on the lowest verandah step watching Kezia who seemed to come,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flying through the air to her feet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ooh!” cried Kezia, flinging up her arms. The grandmother came out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“You found your way in the dark?” said she.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Perfectly well.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But Lottie staggered on the lowest verandah step like a bird fallen out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of the nest. If she stood still for a moment she fell asleep, if she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,leaned against anything her eyes closed. She could not walk another,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,step.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Kezia,” said the grandmother, “can I trust you to carry the lamp?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, my granma.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The old woman bent down and gave the bright breathing thing into her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hands and then she caught up drunken Lottie. “This way.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Through a square hall filled with bales and hundreds of parrots (but,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the parrots were only on the wall-paper) down a narrow passage where,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the parrots persisted in flying past Kezia with her lamp.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Be very quiet,” warned the grandmother, putting down Lottie and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,opening the dining-room door. “Poor little mother has got such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,headache.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Linda Burnell, in a long cane chair, with her feet on a hassock, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"plaid over her knees, lay before a crackling fire. Burnell and Beryl",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sat at the table in the middle of the room eating a dish of fried chops,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and drinking tea out of a brown china teapot. Over the back of her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mother’s chair leaned Isabel. She had a comb in her fingers and in a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,gentle absorbed fashion she was combing the curls from her mother’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forehead. Outside the pool of lamp and firelight the room stretched,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dark and bare to the hollow windows.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Are those the children?” But Linda did not really care; she did not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,even open her eyes to see.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Put down the lamp, Kezia,” said Aunt Beryl, “or we shall have the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, you might just give me five-eighths of a cup,” said Burnell,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leaning across the table. “Have another chop, Beryl. Tip-top meat,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,isn’t it? Not too lean and not too fat.” He turned to his wife. “You’re,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sure you won’t change your mind, Linda darling?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“The very thought of it is enough.” She raised one eyebrow in the way,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she had. The grandmother brought the children bread and milk and they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sat up to table, flushed and sleepy behind the wavy steam.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I had meat for my supper,” said Isabel, still combing gently.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I had a whole chop for my supper, the bone and all and Worcester",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, don’t boast, Isabel,” said Aunt Beryl.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Isabel looked astounded. “I wasn’t boasting, was I, Mummy? I never",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very well. That’s enough,” said Burnell. He pushed back his plate,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“You might see that Fred has a bite of something in the kitchen before,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Yes, Stanley.” The old woman turned to go.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Yes, Stanley.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Burnell got up, stretched himself, and going over to the fire he turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Beryl, sipping tea, her elbows on the table, smiled over the cup at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him. She wore an unfamiliar pink pinafore; the sleeves of her blouse,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were rolled up to her shoulders showing her lovely freckled arms, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she had let her hair fall down her back in a long pig-tail.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“How long do you think it will take to get straight—couple of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Good heavens, no,” said Beryl airily. “The worst is over already. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"servant girl and I have simply slaved all day, and ever since mother",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"came she has worked like a horse, too. We have never sat down for a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,moment. We have had a day.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Stanley scented a rebuke.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, I suppose you did not expect me to rush away from the office and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nail carpets—did you?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Certainly not,” laughed Beryl. She put down her cup and ran out of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dining-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What the hell does she expect us to do?” asked Stanley. “Sit down and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"to do the job? By Jove, if she can’t do a hand’s turn occasionally",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,without shouting about it in return for . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And he gloomed as the chops began to fight the tea in his sensitive,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stomach. But Linda put up a hand and dragged him down to the side of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her long chair.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“This is a wretched time for you, old boy,” she said. Her cheeks were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,very white but she smiled and curled her fingers into the big red hand,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she held. Burnell became quiet. Suddenly he began to whistle “Pure as a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lily, joyous and free”—a good sign.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,4,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They were taken off to bed by the grandmother. She went first with a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,candle; the stairs rang to their climbing feet. Isabel and Lottie lay,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in a room to themselves, Kezia curled in her grandmother’s soft bed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Aren’t there going to be any sheets, my granma?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“It’s tickly,” said Kezia, “but it’s like Indians.” She dragged her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,soon and be my Indian brave.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“What a silly you are,” said the old woman, tucking her in as she loved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Well, can I have the door left open?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She rolled herself up into a round but she did not go to sleep. From,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all over the house came the sound of steps. The house itself creaked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and popped. Loud whispering voices came from downstairs. Once she heard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Aunt Beryl’s rush of high laughter, and once she heard a loud",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,trumpeting from Burnell blowing his nose. Outside the window hundreds,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of black cats with yellow eyes sat in the sky watching her—but she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,not frightened. Lottie was saying to Isabel:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I’m going to say my prayers in bed to-night.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No you can’t, Lottie.” Isabel was very firm. “God only excuses you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saying your prayers in bed if you’ve got a temperature.” So Lottie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And then they lay down back to back, their little behinds just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"touching, and fell asleep.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Standing in a pool of moonlight Beryl Fairfield undressed herself. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was tired, but she pretended to be more tired than she really",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was—letting her clothes fall, pushing back with a languid gesture her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Oh, how tired I am—very tired.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She shut her eyes a moment, but her lips smiled. Her breath rose and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fell in her breast like two fanning wings. The window was wide open; it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was warm, and somewhere out there in the garden a young man, dark and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"slender, with mocking eyes, tip-toed among the bushes, and gathered the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flowers into a big bouquet, and slipped under her window and held it up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to her. She saw herself bending forward. He thrust his head among the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bright waxy flowers, sly and laughing. “No, no,” said Beryl. She turned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,from the window and dropped her nightgown over her head.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“How frightfully unreasonable Stanley is sometimes,” she thought,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"buttoning. And then, as she lay down, there came the old thought, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"A young man, immensely rich, has just arrived from England. He meets",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,talking about it to little Wally Bell to-day and he said he simply,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Good night, Mr. Business Man,” said she, and she took hold of his head",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,to come from a deep well.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Good night, darling.” He slipped his arm under her neck and drew her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, I’m waiting for you,” said Kezia. The old woman sighed and lay",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,down beside her. Kezia thrust her head under the grandmother’s arm and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"gave a little squeak. But the old woman only pressed her faintly, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sighed again, took out her teeth, and put them in a glass of water",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,beside her on the floor.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In the garden some tiny owls, perched on the branches of a lace-bark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tree, called: “More pork; more pork.” And far away in the bush there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sounded a harsh rapid chatter: “Ha-ha-ha . . . Ha-ha-ha.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,5,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Dawn came sharp and chill with red clouds on a faint green sky and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"drops of water on every leaf and blade. A breeze blew over the garden,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dropping dew and dropping petals, shivered over the drenched paddocks,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and was lost in the sombre bush. In the sky some tiny stars floated for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a moment and then they were gone—they were dissolved like bubbles. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,plain to be heard in the early quiet was the sound of the creek in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"paddock running over the brown stones, running in and out of the sandy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hollows, hiding under clumps of dark berry bushes, spilling into a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,swamp of yellow water flowers and cresses.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And then at the first beam of sun the birds began. Big cheeky birds,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"starlings and mynahs, whistled on the lawns, the little birds, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,goldfinches and linnets and fan-tails flicked from bough to bough. A,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lovely kingfisher perched on the paddock fence preening his rich,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"beauty, and a _tui_ sang his three notes and laughed and sang them",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“How loud the birds are,” said Linda in her dream. She was walking with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her father through a green paddock sprinkled with daisies. Suddenly he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bent down and parted the grasses and showed her a tiny ball of fluff,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"just at her feet. “Oh, Papa, the darling.” She made a cup of her hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and caught the tiny bird and stroked its head with her finger. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,quite tame. But a funny thing happened. As she stroked it began to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"swell, it ruffled and pouched, it grew bigger and bigger and its round",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,eyes seemed to smile knowingly at her. Now her arms were hardly wide,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,enough to hold it and she dropped it into her apron. It had become a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"baby with a big naked head and a gaping bird-mouth, opening and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shutting. Her father broke into a loud clattering laugh and she woke to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,see Burnell standing by the windows rattling the Venetian blind up to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the very top.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Hullo,” he said. “Didn’t wake you, did I? Nothing much wrong with the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,weather this morning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He was enormously pleased. Weather like this set a final seal on his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bargain. He felt, somehow, that he had bought the lovely day, too—got",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it chucked in dirt cheap with the house and ground. He dashed off to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,his bath and Linda turned over and raised herself on one elbow to see,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the room by daylight. All the furniture had found a place—all the old,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paraphernalia—as she expressed it. Even the photographs were on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mantelpiece and the medicine bottles on the shelf above the wash-stand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Her clothes lay across a chair—her outdoor things, a purple cape and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round hat with a plume in it. Looking at them she wished that she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"going away from this house, too. And she saw herself driving away from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them all in a little buggy, driving away from everybody and not even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,waving.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Back came Stanley girt with a towel, glowing and slapping his thighs.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He pitched the wet towel on top of her hat and cape, and standing firm",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in the exact centre of a square of sunlight he began to do his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"exercises. Deep breathing, bending and squatting like a frog and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shooting out his legs. He was so delighted with his firm, obedient body",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that he hit himself on the chest and gave a loud “Ah.” But this amazing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,vigour seemed to set him worlds away from Linda. She lay on the white,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tumbled bed and watched him as if from the clouds.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, damn! Oh, blast!” said Stanley, who had butted into a crisp white",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shirt only to find that some idiot had fastened the neck-band and he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was caught. He stalked over to Linda waving his arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You look like a big fat turkey,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Fat. I like that,” said Stanley. “I haven’t a square inch of fat on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,me. Feel that.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s rock—it’s iron,” mocked she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You’d be surprised,” said Stanley, as though this were intensely",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"interesting, “at the number of chaps at the club who have got a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"corporation. Young chaps, you know—men of my age.” He began parting his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bushy ginger hair, his blue eyes fixed and round in the glass, his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"knees bent, because the dressing table was always—confound it—a bit too",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"low for him. “Little Wally Bell, for instance,” and he straightened,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,describing upon himself an enormous curve with the hairbrush. “I must,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,say I’ve a perfect horror . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“My dear, don’t worry. You’ll never be fat. You are far too energetic.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, yes, I suppose that’s true,” said he, comforted for the hundredth",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"time, and taking a pearl pen-knife out of his pocket he began to pare",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,his nails.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Breakfast, Stanley.” Beryl was at the door. “Oh, Linda, mother says",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you are not to get up yet.” She popped her head in at the door. She had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a big piece of syringa stuck through her hair.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Everything we left on the verandah last night is simply sopping this,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,morning. You should see poor dear mother wringing out the tables and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the chairs. However, there is no harm done——” this with the faintest",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,glance at Stanley.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Have you told Pat to have the buggy round in time? It’s a good six and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a half miles to the office.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I can imagine what this early start for the office will be like,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thought Linda. “It will be very high pressure indeed.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Pat, Pat.” She heard the servant girl calling. But Pat was evidently",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hard to find; the silly voice went baa—baaing through the garden.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Linda did not rest again until the final slam of the front door told,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her that Stanley was really gone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Later she heard her children playing in the garden. Lottie’s stolid,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,compact little voice cried: “Ke—zia. Isa—bel.” She was always getting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lost or losing people only to find them again, to her great surprise,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"round the next tree or the next corner. “Oh, there you are after all.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They had been turned out after breakfast and told not to come back to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the house until they were called. Isabel wheeled a neat pramload of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,prim dolls and Lottie was allowed for a great treat to walk beside her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,holding the doll’s parasol over the face of the wax one.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Where are you going to, Kezia?” asked Isabel, who longed to find some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,light and menial duty that Kezia might perform and so be roped in under,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her government.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, just away,” said Kezia. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Then she did not hear them any more. What a glare there was in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"room. She hated blinds pulled up to the top at any time, but in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"morning it was intolerable. She turned over to the wall and idly, with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"one finger, she traced a poppy on the wall-paper with a leaf and a stem",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and a fat bursting bud. In the quiet, and under her tracing finger, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"poppy seemed to come alive. She could feel the sticky, silky petals,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the stem, hairy like a gooseberry skin, the rough leaf and the tight",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,glazed bud. Things had a habit of coming alive like that. Not only,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"large substantial things like furniture, but curtains and the patterns",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of stuffs and the fringes of quilts and cushions. How often she had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seen the tassel fringe of her quilt change into a funny procession of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dancers with priests attending. . . . For there were some tassels that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"did not dance at all but walked stately, bent forward as if praying or",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,chanting. How often the medicine bottles had turned into a row of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little men with brown top-hats on; and the washstand jug had a way of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sitting in the basin like a fat bird in a round nest.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I dreamed about birds last night,” thought Linda. What was it? She had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forgotten. But the strangest part of this coming alive of things was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"what they did. They listened, they seemed to swell out with some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"mysterious important content, and when they were full she felt that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"they smiled. But it was not for her, only, their sly secret smile; they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were members of a secret society and they smiled among themselves.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sometimes, when she had fallen asleep in the daytime, she woke and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"could not lift a finger, could not even turn her eyes to left or right",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,because THEY were there; sometimes when she went out of a room and left,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it empty, she knew as she clicked the door to that THEY were filling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it. And there were times in the evenings when she was upstairs,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"perhaps, and everybody else was down, when she could hardly escape from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them. Then she could not hurry, she could not hum a tune; if she tried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to say ever so carelessly—“Bother that old thimble”—THEY were not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,deceived. THEY knew how frightened she was; THEY saw how she turned her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,head away as she passed the mirror. What Linda always felt was that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"THEY wanted something of her, and she knew that if she gave herself up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and was quiet, more than quiet, silent, motionless, something would",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,really happen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s very quiet now,” she thought. She opened her eyes wide, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heard the silence spinning its soft endless web. How lightly she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,breathed; she scarcely had to breathe at all.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Yes, everything had come alive down to the minutest, tiniest particle,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and she did not feel her bed, she floated, held up in the air. Only she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seemed to be listening with her wide open watchful eyes, waiting for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"someone to come who just did not come, watching for something to happen",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that just did not happen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,6,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,In the kitchen at the long deal table under the two windows old Mrs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Fairfield was washing the breakfast dishes. The kitchen window looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out on to a big grass patch that led down to the vegetable garden and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the rhubarb beds. On one side the grass patch was bordered by the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,scullery and wash-house and over this whitewashed lean-to there grew a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,knotted vine. She had noticed yesterday that a few tiny corkscrew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tendrils had come right through some cracks in the scullery ceiling and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all the windows of the lean-to had a thick frill of ruffled green.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I am very fond of a grape vine,” declared Mrs. Fairfield, “but I do",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,not think that the grapes will ripen here. It takes Australian sun.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And she remembered how Beryl when she was a baby had been picking some,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white grapes from the vine on the back verandah of their Tasmanian,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,house and she had been stung on the leg by a huge red ant. She saw,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Beryl in a little plaid dress with red ribbon tie-ups on the shoulders,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,screaming so dreadfully that half the street rushed in. And how the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,child’s leg had swelled! “T—t—t—t!” Mrs. Fairfield caught her breath,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"remembering. “Poor child, how terrifying it was.” And she set her lips",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tight and went over to the stove for some more hot water. The water,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,frothed up in the big soapy bowl with pink and blue bubbles on top of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the foam. Old Mrs. Fairfield’s arms were bare to the elbow and stained,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a bright pink. She wore a grey foulard dress patterned with large,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"purple pansies, a white linen apron and a high cap shaped like a jelly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mould of white muslin. At her throat there was a silver crescent moon,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with five little owls seated on it, and round her neck she wore a watch",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,guard made of black beads.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was hard to believe that she had not been in that kitchen for years;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she was so much a part of it. She put the crocks away with a sure,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"precise touch, moving leisurely and ample from the stove to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dresser, looking into the pantry and the larder as though there were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"not an unfamiliar comer. When she had finished, everything in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kitchen had become part of a series of patterns. She stood in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,middle of the room wiping her hands on a check cloth; a smile beamed on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her lips; she thought it looked very nice, very satisfactory.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Mother! Mother! Are you there?” called Beryl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, dear. Do you want me?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No. I’m coming,” and Beryl rushed in, very flushed, dragging with her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,two big pictures.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Mother, whatever can I do with these awful hideous Chinese paintings",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that Chung Wah gave Stanley when he went bankrupt? It’s absurd to say,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that they are valuable, because they were hanging in Chung Wah’s fruit",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shop for months before. I can’t make out why Stanley wants them kept.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I’m sure he thinks them just as hideous as we do, but it’s because of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the frames,” she said spitefully. “I suppose he thinks the frames might",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fetch something some day or other.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Why don’t you hang them in the passage?” suggested Mrs. Fairfield;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“they would not be much seen there.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I can’t. There is no room. I’ve hung all the photographs of his office,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there before and after building, and the signed photos of his business",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"friends, and that awful enlargement of Isabel lying on the mat in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,singlet.” Her angry glance swept the placid kitchen. “I know what I’ll,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,do. I’ll hang them here. I will tell Stanley they got a little damp in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the moving so I have put them in here for the time being.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She dragged a chair forward, jumped on it, took a hammer and a big nail",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out of her pinafore pocket and banged away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“There! That is enough! Hand me the picture, mother.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“One moment, child.” Her mother was wiping over the carved ebony frame.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, mother, really you need not dust them. It would take years to dust",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all those little holes.” And she frowned at the top of her mother’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,head and bit her lip with impatience. Mother’s deliberate way of doing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"things was simply maddening. It was old age, she supposed, loftily.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,At last the two pictures were hung side by side. She jumped off the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"chair, stowing away the little hammer.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“They don’t look so bad there, do they?” said she. “And at any rate",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nobody need gaze at them except Pat and the servant girl—have I got a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"spider’s web on my face, mother? I’ve been poking into that cupboard",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,under the stairs and now something keeps tickling my nose.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But before Mrs. Fairfield had time to look Beryl had turned away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Someone tapped on the window: Linda was there, nodding and smiling.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They heard the latch of the scullery door lift and she came in. She had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,no hat on; her hair stood up on her head in curling rings and she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wrapped up in an old cashmere shawl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’m so hungry,” said Linda: “where can I get something to eat, mother?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,This is the first time I’ve been in the kitchen. It says ‘mother’ all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,over; everything is in pairs.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I will make you some tea,” said Mrs. Fairfield, spreading a clean",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"napkin over a corner of the table, “and Beryl can have a cup with you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Beryl, do you want half my gingerbread?” Linda waved the knife at her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Beryl, do you like the house now that we are here?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh yes, I like the house immensely and the garden is beautiful, but it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,feels very far away from everything to me. I can’t imagine people,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"coming out from town to see us in that dreadful jolting bus, and I am",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sure there is not anyone here to come and call. Of course it does not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,matter to you because——”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But there’s the buggy,” said Linda. “Pat can drive you into town",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,whenever you like.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"That was a consolation, certainly, but there was something at the back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of Beryl’s mind, something she did not even put into words for herself.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, well, at any rate it won’t kill us,” she said dryly, putting down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her empty cup and standing up and stretching. “I am going to hang,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,curtains.” And she ran away singing:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,How many thousand birds I see,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,That sing aloud from every tree . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“. . . birds I see That sing aloud from every tree. . . .” But when she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"reached the dining-room she stopped singing, her face changed; it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,became gloomy and sullen.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“One may as well rot here as anywhere else,” she muttered savagely,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,digging the stiff brass safety-pins into the red serge curtains.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The two left in the kitchen were quiet for a little. Linda leaned her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cheek on her fingers and watched her mother. She thought her mother,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,looked wonderfully beautiful with her back to the leafy window. There,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was something comforting in the sight of her that Linda felt she could,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"never do without. She needed the sweet smell of her flesh, and the soft",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,feel of her cheeks and her arms and shoulders still softer. She loved,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the way her hair curled, silver at her forehead, lighter at her neck,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and bright brown still in the big coil under the muslin cap. Exquisite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were her mother’s hands, and the two rings she wore seemed to melt into",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her creamy skin. And she was always so fresh, so delicious. The old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,woman could bear nothing but linen next to her body and she bathed in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cold water winter and summer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Isn’t there anything for me to do?” asked Linda.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, darling. I wish you would go into the garden and give an eye to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,your children; but that I know you will not do.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Of course I will, but you know Isabel is much more grown up than any",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of us.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, but Kezia is not,” said Mrs. Fairfield.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, Kezia has been tossed by a bull hours ago,” said Linda, winding",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,herself up in her shawl again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But no, Kezia had seen a bull through a hole in a knot of wood in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paling that separated the tennis lawn from the paddock. But she had not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"liked the bull frightfully, so she had walked away back through the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"orchard, up the grassy slope, along the path by the lace bark tree and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,so into the spread tangled garden. She did not believe that she would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ever not get lost in this garden. Twice she had found her way back to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the big iron gates they had driven through the night before, and then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"had turned to walk up the drive that led to the house, but there were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,so many little paths on either side. On one side they all led into a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tangle of tall dark trees and strange bushes with flat velvet leaves,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and feathery cream flowers that buzzed with flies when you shook,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them—this was the frightening side, and no garden at all. The little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paths here were wet and clayey with tree roots spanned across them like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the marks of big fowls’ feet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But on the other side of the drive there was a high box border and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paths had box edges and all of them led into a deeper and deeper tangle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of flowers. The camellias were in bloom, white and crimson and pink and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white striped with flashing leaves. You could not see a leaf on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,syringa bushes for the white clusters. The roses were in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flower—gentlemen’s button-hole roses, little white ones, but far too",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"full of insects to hold under anyone’s nose, pink monthly roses with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ring of fallen petals round the bushes, cabbage roses on thick stalks,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moss roses, always in bud, pink smooth beauties opening curl on curl,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"red ones so dark they seemed to turn black as they fell, and a certain",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,exquisite cream kind with a slender red stem and bright scarlet leaves.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"There were clumps of fairy bells, and all kinds of geraniums, and there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were little trees of verbena and bluish lavender bushes and a bed of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pelagoniums with velvet eyes and leaves like moths’ wings. There was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bed of nothing but mignonette and another of nothing but,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pansies—borders of double and single daisies and all kinds of little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tufty plants she had never seen before.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The red-hot pokers were taller than she; the Japanese sunflowers grew,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in a tiny jungle. She sat down on one of the box borders. By pressing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hard at first it made a nice seat. But how dusty it was inside! Kezia,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bent down to look and sneezed and rubbed her nose.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And then she found herself at the top of the rolling grassy slope that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,led down to the orchard. . . . She looked down at the slope a moment;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"then she lay down on her back, gave a squeak and rolled over and over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,into the thick flowery orchard grass. As she lay waiting for things to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stop spinning, she decided to go up to the house and ask the servant",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,girl for an empty match-box. She wanted to make a surprise for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,grandmother. . . . First she would put a leaf inside with a big violet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lying on it, then she would put a very small white picotee, perhaps, on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"each side of the violet, and then she would sprinkle some lavender on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the top, but not to cover their heads.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She often made these surprises for the grandmother, and they were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,always most successful.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Do you want a match, my granny?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Good gracious, child! How you astonished me!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,grass on her slippery shoes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But on her way back to the house she came to that island that lay in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the middle of the drive, dividing the drive into two arms that met in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,front of the house. The island was made of grass banked up high.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Nothing grew on the top except one huge plant with thick, grey-green,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"thorny leaves, and out of the middle there sprang up a tall stout stem.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Some of the leaves of the plant were so old that they curled up in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"air no longer; they turned back, they were split and broken; some of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them lay flat and withered on the ground.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Whatever could it be? She had never seen anything like it before. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stood and stared. And then she saw her mother coming down the path.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Mother, what is it?” asked Kezia.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Linda looked up at the fat swelling plant with its cruel leaves and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fleshy stem. High above them, as though becalmed in the air, and yet",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"holding so fast to the earth it grew from, it might have had claws",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,instead of roots. The curving leaves seemed to be hiding something; the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blind stem cut into the air as if no wind could ever shake it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That is an aloe, Kezia,” said her mother.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Does it ever have any flowers?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, Kezia,” and Linda smiled down at her, and half shut her eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,On his way home from the office Stanley Burnell stopped the buggy at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the Bodega, got out and bought a large bottle of oysters. At the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Chinaman’s shop next door he bought a pineapple in the pink of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"condition, and noticing a basket of fresh black cherries he told John",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to put him a pound of those as well. The oysters and the pine he stowed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"away in the box under the front seat, but the cherries he kept in his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Pat, the handy-man, leapt off the box and tucked him up again in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,brown rug.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Lift yer feet, Mr. Burnell, while I give yer a fold under,” said he.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Right! Right! First-rate!” said Stanley. “You can make straight for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,home now.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Pat gave the grey mare a touch and the buggy sprang forward.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I believe this man is a first-rate chap,” thought Stanley. He liked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the look of him sitting up there in his neat brown coat and brown,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bowler. He liked the way Pat had tucked him in, and he liked his eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was nothing servile about him—and if there was one thing he hated,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,more than another it was servility. And he looked as if he was pleased,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with his job—happy and contented already.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The grey mare went very well; Burnell was impatient to be out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"town. He wanted to be home. Ah, it was splendid to live in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,country—to get right out of that hole of a town once the office was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"closed; and this drive in the fresh warm air, knowing all the while",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that his own house was at the other end, with its garden and paddocks,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,its three tip-top cows and enough fowls and ducks to keep them in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"poultry, was splendid too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,As they left the town finally and bowled away up the deserted road his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heart beat hard for joy. He rooted in the bag and began to eat the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cherries, three or four at a time, chucking the stones over the side of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the buggy. They were delicious, so plump and cold, without a spot or a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bruise on them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Look at those two, now—black one side and white the other—perfect! A",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,perfect little pair of Siamese twins. And he stuck them in his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"button-hole. . . . By Jove, he wouldn’t mind giving that chap up there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a handful—but no, better not. Better wait until he had been with him a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bit longer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He began to plan what he would do with his Saturday afternoons and his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sundays. He wouldn’t go to the club for lunch on Saturday. No, cut away",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,from the office as soon as possible and get them to give him a couple,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of slices of cold meat and half a lettuce when he got home. And then,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he’d get a few chaps out from town to play tennis in the afternoon. Not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"too many—three at most. Beryl was a good player, too. . . . He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stretched out his right arm and slowly bent it, feeling the muscle. . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,". A bath, a good rub-down, a cigar on the verandah after dinner. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,On Sunday morning they would go to church—children and all. Which,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"reminded him that he must hire a pew, in the sun if possible and well",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forward so as to be out of the draught from the door. In fancy he heard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,himself intoning extremely well: “When thou did overcome the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,_Sharp_ness of Death Thou didst open the _King_dom of Heaven to _all_,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Believers.” And he saw the neat brass-edged card on the corner of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pew—Mr. Stanley Burnell and family. . . . The rest of the day he’d loaf,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,about with Linda. . . . Now they were walking about the garden; she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on his arm, and he was explaining to her at length what he intended",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"doing at the office the week following. He heard her saying: “My dear,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I think that is most wise.” . . . Talking things over with Linda was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wonderful help even though they were apt to drift away from the point.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Hang it all! They weren’t getting along very fast. Pat had put the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,brake on again. Ugh! What a brute of a thing it was. He could feel it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in the pit of his stomach.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,A sort of panic overtook Burnell whenever he approached near home.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Before he was well inside the gate he would shout to anyone within,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sight: “Is everything all right?” And then he did not believe it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,until he heard Linda say: “Hullo! Are you home again?” That was the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,worst of living in the country—it took the deuce of a long time to get,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,back. . . . But now they weren’t far off. They were on the top of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,last hill; it was a gentle slope all the way now and not more than half,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a mile.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Pat trailed the whip over the mare’s back and he coaxed her: “Goop now.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Goop now.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It wanted a few minutes to sunset. Everything stood motionless bathed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in bright, metallic light and from the paddocks on either side there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,streamed the milky scent of ripe grass. The iron gates were open. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dashed through and up the drive and round the island, stopping at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,exact middle of the verandah.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Did she satisfy yer, Sir?” said Pat, getting off the box and grinning",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,at his master.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very well indeed, Pat,” said Stanley.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Linda came out of the glass door; her voice rang in the shadowy quiet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Hullo! Are you home again?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,At the sound of her his heart beat so hard that he could hardly stop,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,himself dashing up the steps and catching her in his arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I’m home again. Is everything all right?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Pat began to lead the buggy round to the side gate that opened into the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,courtyard.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Here, half a moment,” said Burnell. “Hand me those two parcels.” And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"he said to Linda, “I’ve brought you back a bottle of oysters and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pineapple,” as though he had brought her back all the harvest of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,earth.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They went into the hall; Linda carried the oysters in one hand and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pineapple in the other. Burnell shut the glass door, threw his hat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"down, put his arms round her and strained her to him, kissing the top",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of her head, her ears, her lips, her eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” said she. “Wait a moment. Let me put down these",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"silly things,” and she put the bottle of oysters and the pine on a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little carved chair. “What have you got in your button-hole—cherries?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She took them out and hung them over his ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Don’t do that, darling. They are for you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,So she took them off his ear again. “You don’t mind if I save them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They’d spoil my appetite for dinner. Come and see your children. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,are having tea.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The lamp was lighted on the nursery table. Mrs. Fairfield was cutting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and spreading bread and butter. The three little girls sat up to table,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wearing large bibs embroidered with their names. They wiped their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mouths as their father came in ready to be kissed. The windows were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"open; a jar of wild flowers stood on the mantelpiece, and the lamp made",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a big soft bubble of light on the ceiling.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You seem pretty snug, mother,” said Burnell, blinking at the light.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Isabel and Lottie sat one on either side of the table, Kezia at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bottom—the place at the top was empty.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That’s where my boy ought to sit,” thought Stanley. He tightened his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"arm round Linda’s shoulder. By God, he was a perfect fool to feel as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,happy as this!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“We are, Stanley. We are very snug,” said Mrs. Fairfield, cutting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Kezia’s bread into fingers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Like it better than town—eh, children?” asked Burnell.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes,” said the three little girls, and Isabel added as an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"after-thought: “Thank you very much indeed, father dear.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Come upstairs,” said Linda. “I’ll bring your slippers.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But the stairs were too narrow for them to go up arm in arm. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,quite dark in the room. He heard her ring tapping on the marble,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mantelpiece as she felt for the matches.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’ve got some, darling. I’ll light the candles.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But instead he came up behind her and again he put his arms round her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and pressed her head into his shoulder.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’m so confoundedly happy,” he said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Are you?” She turned and put her hands on his breast and looked up at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I don’t know what has come over me,” he protested.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was quite dark outside now and heavy dew was falling. When Linda,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shut the window the cold dew touched her finger tips. Far away a dog,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"barked. “I believe there is going to be a moon,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"At the words, and with the cold wet dew on her fingers, she felt as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,though the moon had risen—that she was being strangely discovered in a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flood of cold light. She shivered; she came away from the window and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sat down upon the box ottoman beside Stanley.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In the dining-room, by the flicker of a wood fire, Beryl sat on a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hassock playing the guitar. She had bathed and changed all her clothes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Now she wore a white muslin dress with black spots on it and in her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She played and sang half to herself, for she was watching herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"playing and singing. The firelight gleamed on her shoes, on the ruddy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“If I were outside the window and looked in and saw myself I really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"would be rather struck,” thought she. Still more softly she played the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,". . . “The first time that I ever saw you, little girl—oh, you had no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,popped through.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Please, Miss Beryl, I’ve got to come and lay.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Certainly, Alice,” said Beryl, in a voice of ice. She put the guitar",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in a corner. Alice lunged in with a heavy black iron tray.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, I have had a job with that oving,” said she. “I can’t get",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Really!” said Beryl.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But no, she could not stand that fool of a girl. She ran into the dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"drawing-room and began walking up and down. . . . Oh, she was restless,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,restless. There was a mirror over the mantel. She leaned her arms along,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and looked at her pale shadow in it. How beautiful she looked, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there was nobody to see, nobody.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Why must you suffer so?” said the face in the mirror. “You were not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Beryl smiled, and really her smile was so adorable that she smiled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,The Trout boys were the cousins Kezia had mentioned to the storeman.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They lived about a mile away in a house called Monkey Tree Cottage. Pip,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was tall for his age, with lank black hair and a white face, but Rags",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was very small and so thin that when he was undressed his shoulder,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blades stuck out like two little wings. They had a mongrel dog with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pale blue eyes and a long tail turned up at the end who followed them,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,everywhere; he was called Snooker. They spent half their time combing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and brushing Snooker and dosing him with various awful mixtures,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"concocted by Pip, and kept secretly by him in a broken jug covered with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,an old kettle lid. Even faithful little Rags was not allowed to know,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the full secret of these mixtures. . . . Take some carbolic tooth,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"powder and a pinch of sulphur powdered up fine, and perhaps a bit of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,starch to stiffen up Snooker’s coat. . . . But that was not all; Rags,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,privately thought that the rest was gun-powder. . . . And he never was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,allowed to help with the mixing because of the danger. . . . “Why if a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"spot of this flew in your eye, you would be blinded for life,” Pip",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"would say, stirring the mixture with an iron spoon. “And there’s always",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the chance—just the chance, mind you—of it exploding if you whack it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hard enough. . . . Two spoons of this in a kerosene tin will be enough,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to kill thousands of fleas.” But Snooker spent all his spare time,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"biting and snuffling, and he stank abominably.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,now that they lived in this fine house and boncer garden they were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"girls—Pip, because he could fox them so, and because Lottie was so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"easily frightened, and Rags for a shameful reason. He adored dolls. How",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"he would look at a doll as it lay asleep, speaking in a whisper and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,At the bottom of the orchard a gate was set in the paling fence. On the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,and once up the bank on the other side you were on the fringe of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paddocks. A little old stable in the first paddock had been turned into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a fowl house. The fowls had strayed far away across the paddock down to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a dumping ground in a hollow, but the ducks kept close to that part of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the creek that flowed under the bridge.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Tall bushes overhung the stream with red leaves and yellow flowers and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,clusters of blackberries. At some places the stream was wide and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shallow, but at others it tumbled into deep little pools with foam at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the edges and quivering bubbles. It was in these pools that the big,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He pulled a handful of grain from his pocket and began to walk towards,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,flapping and scrambling up the bank they streamed after him in a long,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"waddling line. He coaxed them, pretending to throw the grain, shaking",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it in his hands and calling to them until they swept round him in a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white ring.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,From far away the fowls heard the clamour and they too came running,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"across the paddock, their heads thrust forward, their wings spread,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,turning in their feet in the silly way fowls run and scolding as they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,came.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Then Pat scattered the grain and the greedy ducks began to gobble.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Quickly he stooped, seized two, one under each arm, and strode across",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to the children. Their darting heads and round eyes frightened the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Will you hold one while I finish with the other?” asked Pat. Pip let,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,go of Snooker. “Won’t I? Won’t I? Give us one. I don’t mind how much he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kicks.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was an old stump beside the door of the fowl-house. Pat grabbed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the duck by the legs, laid it flat across the stump, and almost at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,same moment down came the little tomahawk and the duck’s head flew off,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the stump. Up the blood spurted over the white feathers and over his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When the children saw the blood they were frightened no longer. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,crowded round him and began to scream. Even Isabel leaped about crying:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“The blood! The blood!” Pip forgot all about his duck. He simply threw,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it away from him and shouted, “I saw it. I saw it,” and jumped round",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the wood block.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Rags, with cheeks as white as paper, ran up to the little head, put out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a finger as if he wanted to touch it, shrank back again and then again",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,put out a finger. He was shivering all over.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,“Watch it!” shouted Pat. He put down the body and it began to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,waddle—with only a long spurt of blood where the head had been; it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,began to pad away without a sound towards the steep bank that led to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the stream. . . . That was the crowning wonder.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Do you see that? Do you see that?” yelled Pip. He ran among the little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"you might say, and she fair trembled. But what Alice really hated Miss",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Beryl for was that she made her feel low. She talked to Alice in a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,with a piece of string and a wreath of little balls of stuffing round,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was hard to say which of the two, Alice or the duck, looked the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Burnell ran his eye along the edge of the carving knife. He prided,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,it. He hated seeing a woman carve; they were always too slow and they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,never seemed to care what the meat looked like afterwards. Now he did;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"said Burnell, “this must have been one of those birds whose mother",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,played to it in infancy upon the German flute. And the sweet strains of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Tea was served in the drawing-room, and Beryl, who for some reason had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"been very charming to Stanley ever since he came home, suggested a game",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of crib. They sat at a little table near one of the open windows. Mrs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Fairfield disappeared, and Linda lay in a rocking-chair, her arms above",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her head, rocking to and fro.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You don’t want the light—do you, Linda?” said Beryl. She moved the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"How remote they looked, those two, from where Linda sat and rocked. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"green table, the polished cards, Stanley’s big hands and Beryl’s tiny",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ones, all seemed to be part of one mysterious movement. Stanley",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"himself, big and solid, in his dark suit, took his ease, and Beryl",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tossed her bright head and pouted. Round her throat she wore an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"unfamiliar velvet ribbon. It changed her, somehow—altered the shape of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her face—but it was charming, Linda decided. The room smelled of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The cribbage pegs were like two little people going up the road,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"together, turning round the sharp corner, and coming down the road",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again. They were pursuing each other. They did not so much want to get,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,all.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But no, there was always one who was impatient and hopped away as the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"frightened of the red one, or perhaps he was cruel and would not give",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"the furniture, which had belonged to old Mrs. Fairfield, was dark and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,plain. A little piano stood against the wall with yellow pleated silk,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,let into the carved front. Above it hung an oil painting by Beryl of a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,large cluster of surprised looking clematis. Each flower was the size,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of a small saucer, with a centre like an astonished eye fringed in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,black. But the room was not finished yet. Stanley had set his heart on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"course mother simply loves the place, but then I suppose when I am",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mother’s age I shall be content to sit in the sun and shell peas into a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,basin. But I’m not—not—not.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"What Linda thinks about the whole affair, per usual, I haven’t the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,slightest idea. Mysterious as ever. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"My dear, you know that white satin dress of mine. I have taken the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sleeves out entirely, put bands of black velvet across the shoulders",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and two big red poppies off my dear sister’s _chapeau._ It is a great,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"success, though when I shall wear it I do not know.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Beryl sat writing this letter at a little table in her room. In a way,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of course, it was all perfectly true, but in another way it was all the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"greatest rubbish and she didn’t believe a word of it. No, that wasn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"true. She felt all those things, but she didn’t really feel them like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was her other self who had written that letter. It not only bored,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it rather disgusted her real self.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Flippant and silly,” said her real self. Yet she knew that she’d send",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it and she’d always write that kind of twaddle to Nan Pym. In fact, it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was a very mild example of the kind of letter she generally wrote.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Beryl leaned her elbows on the table and read it through again. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,voice of the letter seemed to come up to her from the page. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"faint already, like a voice heard over the telephone, high, gushing,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with something bitter in the sound. Oh, she detested it to-day.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You’ve always got so much animation,” said Nan Pym. “That’s why men",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"are so keen on you.” And she had added, rather mournfully, for men were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"not at all keen on Nan, who was a solid kind of girl, with fat hips and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a high colour—“I can’t understand how you can keep it up. But it is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"your nature, I suppose.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"What rot. What nonsense. It wasn’t her nature at all. Good heavens, if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she had ever been her real self with Nan Pym, Nannie would have jumped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"out of the window with surprise. . . . My dear, you know that white",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,satin of mine. . . . Beryl slammed the letter-case to.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She jumped up and half unconsciously, half consciously she drifted over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to the looking-glass.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"There stood a slim girl in white—a white serge skirt, a white silk",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"blouse, and a leather belt drawn in very tightly at her tiny waist.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Her face was heart-shaped, wide at the brows and with a pointed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"chin—but not too pointed. Her eyes, her eyes were perhaps her best",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,feature; they were such a strange uncommon colour—greeny blue with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little gold points in them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She had fine black eyebrows and long lashes—so long, that when they lay",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on her cheeks you positively caught the light in them, someone or other",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had told her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Her mouth was rather large. Too large? No, not really. Her underlip",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,protruded a little; she had a way of sucking it in that somebody else,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had told her was awfully fascinating.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Her nose was her least satisfactory feature. Not that it was really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ugly. But it was not half as fine as Linda’s. Linda really had a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,perfect little nose. Hers spread rather—not badly. And in all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,probability she exaggerated the spreadiness of it just because it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her nose, and she was so awfully critical of herself. She pinched it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with a thumb and first finger and made a little face. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Lovely, lovely hair. And such a mass of it. It had the colour of fresh",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fallen leaves, brown and red with a glint of yellow. When she did it in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a long plait she felt it on her backbone like a long snake. She loved,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to feel the weight of it dragging her head back, and she loved to feel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it loose, covering her bare arms. “Yes, my dear, there is no doubt",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"about it, you really are a lovely little thing.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"At the words her bosom lifted; she took a long breath of delight, half",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,closing her eyes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But even as she looked the smile faded from her lips and eyes. Oh God,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there she was, back again, playing the same old game. False—false as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ever. False as when she’d written to Nan Pym. False even when she was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"alone with herself, now.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"What had that creature in the glass to do with her, and why was she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,staring? She dropped down to one side of her bed and buried her face in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh,” she cried, “I am so miserable—so frightfully miserable. I know",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that I’m silly and spiteful and vain; I’m always acting a part. I’m,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"never my real self for a moment.” And plainly, plainly, she saw her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"false self running up and down the stairs, laughing a special trilling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"laugh if they had visitors, standing under the lamp if a man came to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dinner, so that he should see the light on her hair, pouting and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pretending to be a little girl when she was asked to play the guitar.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Why? She even kept it up for Stanley’s benefit. Only last night when he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was reading the paper her false self had stood beside him and leaned,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"against his shoulder on purpose. Hadn’t she put her hand over his,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pointing out something so that he should see how white her hand was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,beside his brown one.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,How despicable! Despicable! Her heart was cold with rage. “It’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"marvellous how you keep it up,” said she to the false self. But then it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was only because she was so miserable—so miserable. If she had been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"happy and leading her own life, her false life would cease to be. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saw the real Beryl—a shadow . . . a shadow. Faint and unsubstantial she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shone. What was there of her except the radiance? And for what tiny,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,moments she was really she. Beryl could almost remember every one of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them. At those times she had felt: “Life is rich and mysterious and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"good, and I am rich and mysterious and good, too.” Shall I ever be that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Beryl for ever? Shall I? How can I? And was there ever a time when I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,did not have a false self? . . . But just as she had got that far she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heard the sound of little steps running along the passage; the door,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,handle rattled. Kezia came in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Aunt Beryl, mother says will you please come down? Father is home with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very well, Kezia.” She went over to the dressing table and powdered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Kezia crossed too, and unscrewed a little pot of cream and sniffed it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Under her arm she carried a very dirty calico cat.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When Aunt Beryl ran out of the room she sat the cat up on the dressing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,table and stuck the top of the cream jar over its ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Now look at yourself,” said she sternly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The calico cat was so overcome by the sight that it toppled over,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,backwards and bumped and bumped on to the floor. And the top of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cream jar flew through the air and rolled like a penny in a round on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the linoleum—and did not break.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But for Kezia it had broken the moment it flew through the air, and she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"picked it up, hot all over, and put it back on the dressing table.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,that there are no portmanteaux to be examined here because the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"clientele of this café, ladies and gentlemen, does not sit down. No, it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stands at the counter, and it consists of a handful of workmen who come",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"up from the river, all powdered over with white flour, lime or",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"something, and a few soldiers, bringing with them thin, dark girls with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,silver rings in their ears and market baskets on their arms.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,shawl with an extraordinary effect. When she is not serving she sits on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a stool with her face turned, always, to the window. Her dark-ringed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"eyes search among and follow after the people passing, but not as if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she was looking for somebody. Perhaps, fifteen years ago, she was; but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,now the pose has become a habit. You can tell from her air of fatigue,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,and left a little woman just when she did not expect him to get up and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leave her, but quite the contrary, I would explain: “He can’t help it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Baby. He has to go back to his ship.” And I believed it far more than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she did.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,All the while we were together Dick never went with a woman. I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sometimes wondered whether he wasn’t completely innocent. Why didn’t I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ask him? Because I never did ask him anything about himself. But late,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,one night he took out his pocket-book and a photograph dropped out of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it. I picked it up and glanced at it before I gave it to him. It was of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a woman. Not quite young. Dark, handsome, wild-looking, but so full in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,every line of a kind of haggard pride that even if Dick had not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"for the concierge to release the catch of the outer door, he said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,looking up at the sky: “I hope it will be fine to-morrow. I am leaving,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Ah, I wish I’d known at the beginning of the evening!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,that its claim is the stronger. “Why didn’t you tell me?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,As far as I could make out she had dark hair and blue or black eyes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,important.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She wore a long dark cloak such as one sees in old-fashioned pictures,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Carrying out the mouse idea,” I decided.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Ah, but how intriguing it was—how intriguing! Their excitement came",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"nearer and nearer to me, while I ran out to meet it, bathed in it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flung myself far out of my depth, until at last I was as hard put to it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to keep control as they.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But what I wanted to do was to behave in the most extraordinary,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fashion—like a clown. To start singing, with large extravagant",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"gestures, to point out of the window and cry: “We are now passing,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ladies and gentlemen, one of the sights for which _notre Paris_ is",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"justly famous,” to jump out of the taxi while it was going, climb over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the roof and dive in by another door; to hang out of the window and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"look for the hotel through the wrong end of a broken telescope, which",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was also a peculiarly ear-splitting trumpet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I watched myself do all this, you understand, and even managed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"applaud in a private way by putting my gloved hands gently together,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,while I said to Mouse: “And is this your first visit to Paris?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I’ve not been here before.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, then you have a great deal to see.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,the museums when we wrenched to a stop.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Do you know—it’s very absurd—but as I pushed open the door for them and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,followed up the stairs to the bureau on the landing I felt somehow that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,this hotel was mine.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was a vase of flowers on the window sill of the bureau and I even,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,went so far as to re-arrange a bud or two and to stand off and note the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,effect while the manageress welcomed them. And when she turned to me,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and handed me the keys (the _garçon_ was hauling up the boxes) and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,said: “Monsieur Duquette will show you your rooms”—I had a longing to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tap Dick on the arm with a key and say, very confidentially: “Look",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"here, old chap. As a friend of mine I’ll be only too willing to make a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,slight reduction . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,(why is it one never sees an attractive pair of boots outside a door?).,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They so obviously did not care why I chose them that I went no further.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They accepted everything. They did not expect anything to be different.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,This was just part of what they were going through—that was how I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,analysed it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Arrived at last.” I ran from one side of the passage to the other,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"turning on the lights, explaining.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“This one I thought for you, Dick. The other is larger and it has a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"My “proprietary” eye noted the clean towels and covers, and the bed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"linen embroidered in red cotton. I thought them rather charming rooms,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sloping, full of angles, just the sort of rooms one would expect to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,find if one had not been to Paris before.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Dick dashed his hat down on the bed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Oughtn’t I to help that chap with the boxes?” he asked—nobody.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, you ought,” replied Mouse, “they’re dreadfully heavy.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And she turned to me with the first glimmer of a smile: “Books, you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"know.” Oh, he darted such a strange look at her before he rushed out.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And he not only helped, he must have torn the box off the _garçon’s_",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"back, for he staggered back, carrying one, dumped it down and then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fetched in the other.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That’s yours, Dick,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, you don’t mind it standing here for the present, do you?” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"asked, breathless, breathing hard (the box must have been tremendously",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heavy). He pulled out a handful of money. “I suppose I ought to pay,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,this chap.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The _garçon_, standing by, seemed to think so too.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“And will you require anything further, Monsieur?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“No! No!” said Dick impatiently.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But at that Mouse stepped forward. She said, too deliberately, not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"looking at Dick, with her quaint clipped English accent: “Yes, I’d like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,some tea. Tea for three.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And suddenly she raised her muff as though her hands were clasped,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"inside it, and she was telling the pale, sweaty _garçon_ by that action",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that she was at the end of her resources, that she cried out to him to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,save her with “Tea. Immediately!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"This seemed to me so amazingly in the picture, so exactly the gesture",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and cry that one would expect (though I couldn’t have imagined it) to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"be wrung out of an Englishwoman faced with a great crisis, that I was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,almost tempted to hold up my hand and protest.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“No! No! Enough. Enough. Let us leave off there. At the word—tea. For,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"really, really, you’ve filled your greediest subscriber so full that he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,will burst if he has to swallow another word.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It even pulled Dick up. Like someone who has been unconscious for a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,long long time he turned slowly to Mouse and slowly looked at her with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his tired, haggard eyes, and murmured with the echo of his dreamy",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"voice: “Yes. That’s a good idea.” And then: “You must be tired, Mouse.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Sit down.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She sat down in a chair with lace tabs on the arms; he leaned against,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the bed, and I established myself on a straight-backed chair, crossed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,my legs and brushed some imaginary dust off the knees of my trousers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,(The Parisian at his ease.),The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There came a tiny pause. Then he said: “Won’t you take off your coat.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Mouse?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, thanks. Not just now.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Were they going to ask me? Or should I hold up my hand and call out in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a baby voice: “It’s my turn to be asked.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"No, I shouldn’t. They didn’t ask me.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The pause became a silence. A real silence.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“. . . Come, my Parisian fox-terrier! Amuse these sad English! It’s no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wonder they are such a nation for dogs.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But, after all—why should I? It was not my “job,” as they would say.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Nevertheless, I made a vivacious little bound at Mouse.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What a pity it is that you did not arrive by daylight. There is such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"charming view from these two windows. You know, the hotel is on a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"corner and each window looks down an immensely long, straight street.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not that that sounds very charming,” I laughed. “But there is so much",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,animation—so many absurd little boys on bicycles and people hanging out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of windows and—oh, well, you’ll see for yourself in the morning. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Very amusing. Very animated.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"If the pale, sweaty _garçon_ had not come in at that moment, carrying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the tea-tray high on one hand as if the cups were cannon-balls and he a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heavy weight lifter on the cinema. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He managed to lower it on to a round table.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Bring the table over here,” said Mouse. The waiter seemed to be the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"only person she cared to speak to. She took her hands out of her muff,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,drew off her gloves and flung back the old-fashioned cape.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Do you take milk and sugar?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No milk, thank you, and no sugar.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I went over for mine like a little gentleman. She poured out another,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cup.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“That’s for Dick.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And the faithful fox-terrier carried it across to him and laid it at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his feet, as it were.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, thanks,” said Dick.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And then I went back to my chair and she sank back in hers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But Dick was off again. He stared wildly at the cup of tea for a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moment, glanced round him, put it down on the bed-table, caught up his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hat and stammered at full gallop: “Oh, by the way, do you mind posting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a letter for me? I want to get it off by to-night’s post. I must. It’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"very urgent. . . .” Feeling her eyes on him, he flung: “It’s to my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mother.” To me: “I won’t be long. I’ve got everything I want. But it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,must go off to-night You don’t mind? It . . . it won’t take any time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Of course I’ll post it. Delighted.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Won’t you drink your tea first?” suggested Mouse softly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,". . . Tea? Tea? Yes, of course. Tea. . . . A cup of tea on the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bed-table. . . . In his racing dream he flashed the brightest, most",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,charming smile at his little hostess.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, thanks. Not just now.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And still hoping it would not be any trouble to me he went out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"room and closed the door, and we heard him cross the passage.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I scalded myself with mine in my hurry to take the cup back to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,table and to say as I stood there: “You must forgive me if I am,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,impertinent . . . if I am too frank. But Dick hasn’t tried to disguise,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it—has he? There is something the matter. Can I help?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"(Soft music. Mouse gets up, walks the stage for a moment or so before",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she returns to her chair and pours him out, oh, such a brimming, such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,burning cup that the tears come into the friend’s eyes while he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sips—while he drains it to the bitter dregs. . . .),The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I had time to do all this before she replied. First she looked in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"teapot, filled it with hot water, and stirred it with a spoon.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, there is something the matter. No, I’m afraid you can’t help,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thank you.” Again I got that glimmer of a smile. “I’m awfully sorry. It,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,must be horrid for you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Horrid, indeed! Ah, why couldn’t I tell her that it was months and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,months since I had been so entertained?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But you are suffering,” I ventured softly, as though that was what I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could not bear to see.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She didn’t deny it. She nodded and bit her under-lip and I thought I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saw her chin tremble.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“And there is really nothing I can do?” More softly still.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She shook her head, pushed back the table and jumped up.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, it will be all right soon,” she breathed, walking over to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dressing-table and standing with her back towards me. “It will be all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,right. It can’t go on like this.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But of course it can’t.” I agreed, wondering whether it would look",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,heartless if I lit a cigarette; I had a sudden longing to smoke.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In some way she saw my hand move to my breast pocket, half draw out my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cigarette case and put it back again, for the next thing she said was:",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Matches . . . in . . . candlestick. I noticed them.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And I heard from her voice that she was crying.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Ah! thank you. Yes. Yes. I’ve found them.” I lighted my cigarette and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"walked up and down, smoking.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was so quiet it might have been two o’clock in the morning. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,so quiet you heard the boards creak and pop as one does in a house in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the country. I smoked the whole cigarette and stabbed the end into my,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saucer before Mouse turned round and came back to the table.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Isn’t Dick being rather a long time?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You are very tired. I expect you want to go to bed,” I said kindly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"(And pray don’t mind me if you do, said my mind.)",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“But isn’t he being a very long time?” she insisted.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I shrugged. “He is, rather.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Then I saw she looked at me strangely. She was listening.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“He’s been gone ages,” she said, and she went with little light steps",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to the door, opened it, and crossed the passage into his room.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I waited. I listened too, now. I couldn’t have borne to miss a word.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She had left the door open. I stole across the room and looked after,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her. Dick’s door was open, too. But—there wasn’t a word to miss.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,You know I had the mad idea that they were kissing in that quiet room—a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,long comfortable kiss. One of those kisses that not only puts one’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"grief to bed, but nurses it and warms it and tucks it up and keeps it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fast enfolded until it is sleeping sound. Ah! how good that is.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was over at last. I heard some one move and tip-toed away.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was Mouse. She came back. She felt her way into the room carrying,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the letter for me. But it wasn’t in an envelope; it was just a sheet of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paper and she held it by the corner as though it was still wet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Her head was bent so low—so tucked in her furry collar that I hadn’t a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,notion—until she let the paper fall and almost fell herself on to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"floor by the side of the bed, leaned her cheek against it, flung out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her hands as though the last of her poor little weapons was gone and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"now she let herself be carried away, washed out into the deep water.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,don’t you agree? It’s all so unspeakably awful that I don’t know if I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,want to go or not. Do I? Or is Mother just dragging me? I don’t know.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"My head is too tired. Mouse, Mouse—what will you do? But I can’t think",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of that, either. I dare not. I’d break down. And I must not break down.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,All I’ve got to do is—just to tell you this and go. I couldn’t have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,that. And don’t write. I should not have the courage to answer your,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,letters and the sight of your spidery handwriting——,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What do you think of that? Wasn’t that a rare find? My relief at his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,Englishman. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"dipped her handkerchief into the jug and sponged her eyes, saying: “Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,no. It’s not incredible at all.” And still pressing the wet ball to her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"eyes she came back to me, to her chair with the lace tabs, and sank",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,into it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“And what are your plans?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Yes, I know. My question was the most clumsy, the most idiotic one I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"rate spiritually speaking, hold her tiny quivering body in one hand and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stroke her furry head—and now, I’d thrown her away. Oh, I could have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"tone in with the new dining-room carpet. Yes, that did sound rather",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"far-fetched and absurd, but it was really why she had bought them. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had thought in the shop: “I must have some purple ones to bring the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,something strange about them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The provoking thing was that, though they had been about together and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"met a number of times and really talked, Bertha couldn’t yet make her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"out. Up to a certain point Miss Fulton was rarely, wonderfully frank,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"but the certain point was there, and beyond that she would not go.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Was there anything beyond it? Harry said “No.” Voted her dullish, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“cold like all blond women, with a touch, perhaps, of anæmia of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, the way she has of sitting with her head a little on one side, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"smiling, has something behind it, Harry, and I must find out what that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,something is.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Most likely it’s a good stomach,” answered Harry.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He made a point of catching Bertha’s heels with replies of that kind .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,". . “liver frozen, my dear girl,” or “pure flatulence,” or “kidney",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"disease,” . . . and so on. For some strange reason Bertha liked this,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and almost admired it in him very much.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She went into the drawing-room and lighted the fire; then, picking up",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the cushions, one by one, that Mary had disposed so carefully, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,threw them back on to the chairs and the couches. That made all the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,difference; the room came alive at once. As she was about to throw the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"last one she surprised herself by suddenly hugging it to her,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"passionately, passionately. But it did not put out the fire in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bosom. Oh, on the contrary!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The windows of the drawing-room opened on to a balcony overlooking the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"garden. At the far end, against the wall, there was a tall, slender",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pear tree in fullest, richest bloom; it stood perfect, as though",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"becalmed against the jade-green sky. Bertha couldn’t help feeling, even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"from this distance, that it had not a single bud or a faded petal. Down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"below, in the garden beds, the red and yellow tulips, heavy with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flowers, seemed to lean upon the dusk. A grey cat, dragging its belly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"crept across the lawn, and a black one, its shadow, trailed after. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sight of them, so intent and so quick, gave Bertha a curious shiver.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“What creepy things cats are!” she stammered, and she turned away from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the window and began walking up and down. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"How strong the jonquils smelled in the warm room. Too strong? Oh, no.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And yet, as though overcome, she flung down on a couch and pressed her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hands to her eyes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I’m too happy—too happy!” she murmured.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And she seemed to see on her eyelids the lovely pear tree with its wide,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,open blossoms as a symbol of her own life.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Really—really—she had everything. She was young. Harry and she were as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"much in love as ever, and they got on together splendidly and were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,really good pals. She had an adorable baby. They didn’t have to worry,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,about money. They had this absolutely satisfactory house and garden.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And friends—modern, thrilling friends, writers and painters and poets",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,or people keen on social questions—just the kind of friends they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wanted. And then there were books, and there was music, and she had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"found a wonderful little dressmaker, and they were going abroad in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"summer, and their new cook made the most superb omelettes. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’m absurd. Absurd!” She sat up; but she felt quite dizzy, quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,drunk. It must have been the spring.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Yes, it was the spring. Now she was so tired she could not drag herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,upstairs to dress.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"A white dress, a string of jade beads, green shoes and stockings. It",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wasn’t intentional. She had thought of this scheme hours before she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stood at the drawing-room window.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Her petals rustled softly into the hall, and she kissed Mrs. Norman",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"sense of humour! My dear, it’s only by a fluke that I am here at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all—Norman being the protective fluke. For my darling monkeys so upset,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the train that it rose to a man and simply ate me with its eyes. Didn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"laugh—wasn’t amused—that I should have loved. No, just stared—and bored",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But the cream of it was,” said Norman, pressing a large",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"each other Face and Mug.) “The cream of it was when she, being full",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fed, turned to the woman beside her and said: ‘Haven’t you ever seen a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes!” Mrs. Norman Knight joined in the laughter. “Wasn’t that too",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,absolutely creamy?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And a funnier thing still was that now her coat was off she did look,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,like a very intelligent monkey—who had even made that yellow silk dress,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out of scraped banana skins. And her amber ear-rings; they were like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,yet she couldn’t hurry. She could almost have cried: “Give me time.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"strange naive way, and said, “except this studio.” He looked round him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and then at her; he laughed in his astonishment and pleasure. He was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I love that little boy,” he murmured. And then they both were silent.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,A new silence came between them. Nothing in the least like the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"satisfactory pause that had followed their greetings—the “Well, here we",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"are together again, and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t go on from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,just where we left off last time.” That silence could be contained in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,hadn’t they flung something into it just for the fun of watching the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ripples break on the easy shores. But into this unfamiliar pool the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,head of the little boy sleeping his timeless sleep dropped—and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"made up the fire and put the table back, the blue chair was wheeled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,other up? Was this really anything more than a wonderfully good,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,imitation of other occasions? His heart beat; her cheek burned and the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stupid thing was she could not discover where exactly they were or what,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,exactly was happening. She hadn’t time to glance back. And just as she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"had got so far it happened again. They faltered, wavered, broke down,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were silent. Again they were conscious of the boundless, questioning",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dark. Again, there they were—two hunters, bending over their fire, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hearing suddenly from the jungle beyond a shake of wind and a loud,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,questioning cry. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"happen then? But no. Vague and troubled though they were, they knew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,enough to realize their precious friendship was in danger. She was the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I do. And I think it’s because this generation is just wise",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,enough to know that it is sick and to realize that its only chance of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,recovery is by going into its symptoms—making an exhaustive study of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But oh,” she wailed. “What a dreadfully dismal outlook.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not at all,” said he. “Look here . . .” On the talk went. And now it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seemed they really had succeeded. She turned in her chair to look at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him while she answered. Her smile said: “We have won.” And he smiled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"back, confident: “Absolutely.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But the smile undid them. It lasted too long; it became a grin. They,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saw themselves as two little grinning puppets jigging away in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nothingness.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What have we been talking about?” thought he. He was so utterly bored,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he almost groaned.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“What a spectacle we have made of ourselves,” thought she. And she saw",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"him laboriously—oh, laboriously—laying out the grounds and herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"running after, putting here a tree and there a flowery shrub and here a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,handful of glittering fish in a pool. They were silent this time from,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sheer dismay.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The clock struck six merry little pings and the fire made a soft,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,upholstered minds.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And now the silence put a spell upon them like solemn music. It was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,anguish—anguish for her to bear it and he would die—he’d die if it were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,broken. . . . And yet he longed to break it. Not by speech. At any rate,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,not by their ordinary maddening chatter. There was another way for them,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to speak to each other, and in the new way he wanted to murmur: “Do you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,feel this too? Do you understand it at all?” . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Instead, to his horror, he heard himself say: “I must be off; I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What devil made him say that instead of the other? She jumped—simply,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"jumped out of her chair, and he heard her crying: “You must rush, then.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“You’ve hurt me; you’ve hurt me! We’ve failed!” said her secret self,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"while she handed him his hat and stick, smiling gaily. She wouldn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"give him a moment for another word, but ran along the passage and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,opened the big outer door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Could they leave each other like this? How could they? He stood on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You’ve hurt me—hurt me,” said her heart. “Why don’t you go? No, don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She saw the beautiful fall of the steps, the dark garden ringed with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"glittering ivy, on the other side of the road the huge bare willows and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,above them the sky big and bright with stars. But of course he would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,see nothing of all this. He was superior to it all. He—with his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wonderful “spiritual” vision!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She was right. He did see nothing at all. Misery! He’d missed it. It,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was too late to do anything now. Was it too late? Yes, it was. A cold",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,snatch of hateful wind blew into the garden. Curse life! He heard her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cry “au revoir” and the door slammed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Running back into the studio she behaved so strangely. She ran up and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,down lifting her arms and crying: “Oh! Oh! How stupid! How imbecile!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,How stupid!” And then she flung herself down on the _sommier_ thinking,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of nothing—just lying there in her rage. All was over. What was over?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Oh—something was. And she’d never see him again—never. After a long,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,long time (or perhaps ten minutes) had passed in that black gulf her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bell rang a sharp quick jingle. It was he, of course. And equally, of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"course, she oughtn’t to have paid the slightest attention to it but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,just let it go on ringing and ringing. She flew to answer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"dear, send me away!” She never did. As a rule she asked her in and let",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Now let me see,” said Mr. Bithem slowly, staring; he had only seen",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Miss Moss four times a week for the past—how many weeks? “Now, who are",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Miss Ada Moss.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes, yes; of course, my dear. Not yet, my dear. Now I had a call",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"for twenty-eight ladies to-day, but they had to be young and able to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hop it a bit—see? And I had another call for sixteen—but they had to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"know something about sand-dancing. Look here, my dear, I’m up to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,eyebrows this morning. Come back on Monday week; it’s no good coming,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before that.” He gave her a whole grin to herself and patted her fat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,At the North-East Film Company the crowd was all the way up the stairs.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Miss Moss found herself next to a fair little baby thing about thirty,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in a white lace hat with cherries round it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What a crowd!” said she. “Anything special on?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“_Didn’t_ you know, dear?” said the baby, opening her immense pale",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,eyes. “There was a call at nine-thirty for _attractive_ girls. We’ve,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all been waiting for _hours._ Have you played for this company before?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Miss Moss put her head on one side. “No, I don’t think I have.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“They’re a lovely company to play for,” said the baby. “A friend of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,much for the _fil_-lums?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, I’m not an actress by profession,” confessed Miss Moss. “I’m a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,contralto singer. But things have been so bad lately that I’ve been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,doing a little.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, you weren’t to have been _paid._ The North-East never _pay_ their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was only a little round window at the Bitter Orange Company. No,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"waiting-room—nobody at all except a girl, who came to the window when",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Miss Moss knocked, and said: “Well?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Can I see the producer, please?” said Miss Moss pleasantly. The girl",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leaned on the window-bar, half shut her eyes and seemed to go to sleep",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,for a moment. Miss Moss smiled at her. The girl not only frowned; she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seemed to smell something vaguely unpleasant; she sniffed. Suddenly she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moved away, came back with a paper and thrust it at Miss Moss.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Fill up the form!” said she. And banged the window down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Can you aviate—high-dive—drive a car—buck-jump—shoot?” read Miss Moss.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She walked along the street asking herself those questions. There was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"high, cold wind blowing; it tugged at her, slapped her face, jeered; it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,knew she could not answer them. In the Square Gardens she found a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little wire basket to drop the form into. And then she sat down on one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of the benches to powder her nose. But the person in the pocket mirror,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"made a hideous face at her, and that was too much for Miss Moss; she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had a good cry. It cheered her wonderfully.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, that’s over,” she sighed. “It’s one comfort to be off my feet.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And my nose will soon get cool in the air. . . . It’s very nice in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,here. Look at the sparrows. Cheep. Cheep. How close they come. I expect,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"somebody feeds them. No, I’ve nothing for you, you cheeky little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,things. . . .” She looked away from them. What was the big building,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"opposite—the Café de Madrid? My goodness, what a smack that little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,child came down! Poor little mite! Never mind—up again. . . . By eight,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,o’clock to-night . . . Café de Madrid. “I could just go in and sit,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there and have a coffee, that’s all,” thought Miss Moss. “It’s such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,place for artists too. I might just have a stroke of luck. . . . A dark,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"handsome gentleman in a fur coat comes in with a friend, and sits at my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"table, perhaps. ‘No, old chap, I’ve searched London for a contralto and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I can’t find a soul. You see, the music is difficult; have a look at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it.’” And Miss Moss heard herself saying: “Excuse me, I happen to be a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"contralto, and I have sung that part many times. . . . Extraordinary!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,‘Come back to my studio and I’ll try your voice now.’ . . . Ten pounds,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a week. . . . Why should I feel nervous? It’s not nervousness. Why,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shouldn’t I go to the Café de Madrid? I’m a respectable woman—I’m a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,contralto singer. And I’m only trembling because I’ve had nothing to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,Hardly had she sat down when a very stout gentleman wearing a very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,small hat that floated on the top of his head like a little yacht,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flopped into the chair opposite hers.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Good evening!” said he.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Fine evening,” said the stout gentleman.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, very fine. Quite a treat, isn’t it?” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He crooked a sausage finger at the waiter—“Bring me a large whisky”—and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,turned to Miss Moss. “What’s yours?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, I think I’ll take a brandy if it’s all the same.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,“That’s a tempting bit o’ ribbon!” said he.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,brilliant eyes and teeth. He was dressed “English fashion” in a flannel,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"jacket, white trousers and shoes. Round his neck he wore a silk scarf;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his head, with his hair brushed back, was bare. And he kept mopping his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"forehead, rubbing his hands with a brilliant handkerchief. Her white",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,skirt had a patch of wet; her neck and throat were stained a deep pink.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When she lifted her arms big half-hoops of perspiration showed under,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her arm-pits; her hair clung in wet curls to her cheeks. She looked as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"though her young husband had been dipping her in the sea, and fishing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her out again to dry in the sun and then—in with her again—all day.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Would Klaymongso like a fish?” they cried. Their laughing voices,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Right.” He stumped the cigarette into an ash-tray and sauntered over,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He came back with it and she bent her small head while he dropped it on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"the quivering air. Out of the thick, fleshy leaves of a cactus there",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,rose an aloe stem loaded with pale flowers that looked as though they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had been cut out of butter; light flashed upon the lifted spears of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"tubs and tramping up and down. They screamed, their hair fell over",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"their faces, they splashed one another. But suddenly, the smallest, who",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"had a tub to herself, glanced up and saw who was looking. For a moment",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she seemed overcome with terror, then clumsily she struggled and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"strained out of her tub, and still holding her clothes above her waist.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“The Englishman! The Englishman!” she shrieked and fled away to hide.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Shrieking and screaming, the other two followed her. In a moment they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,“How—very—extraordinary!” said she. “What made them so frightened?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"For a moment he did not answer. Then he met her glance, and smiling his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"_Très_ rum! Oh, she felt quite faint. Oh, why should she love him so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,much just because he said a thing like that. _Très_ rum! That was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Oh!” She caught her breath. “Very, very much.” And she clasped the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,quickly.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The gates of the Pension Villa Excelsior were open wide, jammed open",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"against some bold geraniums. Stooping a little, staring straight ahead,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"walking swiftly, he passed through them and began climbing the hill",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that wound behind the town like a great rope looping the villas,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,together. The dust lay thick. A carriage came bowling along driving,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,towards the Excelsior. In it sat the General and the Countess; they had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,been for his daily airing. Mr. Salesby stepped to one side but the dust,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"beat up, thick, white, stifling like wool. The Countess just had time",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to nudge the General.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“There he goes,” she said spitefully.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It is the Englishman,” said the driver, turning round and smiling. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the Countess threw up her hands and nodded so amiably that he spat with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,satisfaction and gave the stumbling horse a cut.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"On—on—past the finest villas in the town, magnificent palaces, palaces",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"carved grottoes and statues and stone animals drinking at the fountain,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,into a poorer quarter. Here the road ran narrow and foul between high,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lean houses, the ground floors of which were scooped and hollowed into",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stables and carpenters’ shops. At a fountain ahead of him two old hags,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were beating linen. As he passed them they squatted back on their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"haunches, stared, and then their “A-hak-kak-kak!” with the slap, slap,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of the stone on the linen sounded after him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He reached the top of the hill; he turned a corner and the town was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hidden. Down he looked into a deep valley with a dried up river bed at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the bottom. This side and that was covered with small dilapidated,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"houses that had broken stone verandahs where the fruit lay drying,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tomato lanes in the garden, and from the gates to the doors a trellis",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of vines. The late sunlight, deep, golden, lay in the cup of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,valley; there was a smell of charcoal in the air. In the gardens the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,men were cutting grapes. He watched a man standing in the greenish,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shade, raising up, holding a black cluster in one hand, taking the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"knife from his belt, cutting, laying the bunch in a flat boat-shaped",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"basket. The man worked leisurely, silently, taking hundreds of years",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,over the job. On the hedges on the other side of the road there were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"grapes small as berries, growing wild, growing among the stones. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leaned against a wall, filled his pipe, put a match to it. . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"Leaned across a gate, turned up the collar of his mackintosh. It was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"going to rain. It didn’t matter, he was prepared for it. You didn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,expect anything else in November. He looked over the bare field. From,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the corner by the gate there came the smell of swedes, a great stack of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them, wet, rank coloured. Two men passed walking towards the straggling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,village. “Good day!” “Good day!” By Jove! he had to hurry if he was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"going to catch that train home. Over the gate, across a field, over the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stile, into the lane, swinging along in the drifting rain and dusk. . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"drawing-room; Jinnie is sitting pretty nearly in the fire. “Oh, Robert,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I didn’t hear you come in. Did you have a good time? How nice you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,smell! A present?” “Some bits of blackberry I picked for you. Pretty,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"her on the look-out. She got up, waved and slowly she came to meet him,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dragging the heavy cape. In her hand she carried a spray of heliotrope.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,hours to get over it—simply hours. She came into the room buttoned up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in an overall, with a handkerchief over her head—thereby proving that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,inspiration for the day stifling under those thudding blows. It seemed,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that she took a malicious delight in making life more difficult for him,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"than—Heaven knows—it was, by denying him his rights as an artist, by",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,trying to drag him down to her level. What was the matter with her?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What the hell did she want? Hadn’t he three times as many pupils now as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"when they were first married, earned three times as much, paid for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"every stick and stone that they possessed, and now had begun to shell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out for Adrian’s kindergarten? . . . And had he ever reproached her for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,not having a penny to her name? Never a word—never a sign! The truth,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was that once you married a woman she became insatiable, and the truth",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was that nothing was more fatal for an artist than marriage, at any",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,rate until he was well over forty. . . . Why had he married her? He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"asked himself this question on an average about three times a day, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he never could answer it satisfactorily. She had caught him at a weak,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moment, when the first plunge into reality had bewildered and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"overwhelmed him for a time. Looking back, he saw a pathetic, youthful",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"creature, half child, half wild untamed bird, totally incompetent to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cope with bills and creditors and all the sordid details of existence.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Well—she had done her best to clip his wings, if that was any",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"satisfaction for her, and she could congratulate herself on the success",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of this early morning trick. One ought to wake exquisitely,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"reluctantly, he thought, slipping down in the warm bed. He began to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"imagine a series of enchanting scenes which ended with his latest, most",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"charming pupil putting her bare, scented arms round his neck, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"covering him with her long, perfumed hair. “Awake, my love!” . . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and upon the word “wedded” he burst into such a shout of triumph that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the tooth-glass on the bathroom shelf trembled and even the bath tap,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seemed to gush stormy applause. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Well, there was nothing wrong with his voice, he thought, leaping into",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"like a fish. He could fill Covent Garden with it! “_Wedded_,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shouted again, seizing the towel with a magnificent operatic gesture,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and went on singing while he rubbed as though he had been Lohengrin,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tipped out by an unwary Swan and drying himself in the greatest haste,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before that tiresome Elsa came along along. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,upon the pale square of sunlight that lay upon the carpet like a sheet,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of cream blotting-paper, he began to do his exercises—deep breathing,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bending forward and back, squatting like a frog and shooting out his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,legs—for if there was one thing he had a horror of it was of getting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fat, and men in his profession had a dreadful tendency that way.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"However, there was no sign of it at present. He was, he decided, just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"right, just in good proportion. In fact, he could not help a thrill of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"satisfaction when he saw himself in the glass, dressed in a morning",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"coat, dark grey trousers, grey socks and a black tie with a silver",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thread in it. Not that he was vain—he couldn’t stand vain men—no; the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sight of himself gave him a thrill of purely artistic satisfaction.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“_Voilà tout!”_ said he, passing his hand over his sleek hair.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"That little, easy French phrase blown so lightly from his lips, like a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"whiff of smoke, reminded him that someone had asked him again, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"evening before, if he was English. People seemed to find it impossible",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to believe that he hadn’t some Southern blood. True, there was an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,emotional quality in his singing that had nothing of the John Bull in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it. . . . The door-handle rattled and turned round and round. Adrian’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,head popped through.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Please, father, mother says breakfast is quite ready, please.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Yes, father.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,A few months ago Reginald had spent a week-end in a very aristocratic,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"family, where the father received his little sons in the morning and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shook hands with them. Reginald thought the practice charming, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"introduced it immediately, but Adrian felt dreadfully silly at having",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to shake hands with his own father every morning. And why did his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,father always sort of sing to him instead of talk? . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In excellent temper, Reginald walked into the dining-room and sat down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"before a pile of letters, a copy of the _Times_, and a little covered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dish. He glanced at the letters and then at his breakfast. There were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,two thin slices of bacon and one egg.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Don’t you want any bacon?” he asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, I prefer a cold baked apple. I don’t feel the need of bacon every",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,morning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Now, did she mean that there was no need for him to have bacon every",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"morning, either, and that she grudged having to cook it for him?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“If you don’t want to cook the breakfast,” said he, “why don’t you keep",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a servant? You know we can afford one, and you know how I loathe to see",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,my wife doing the work. Simply because all the women we have had in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"past have been failures and utterly upset my regime, and made it almost",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"impossible for me to have any pupils here, you’ve given up trying to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,find a decent woman. It’s not impossible to train a servant—is it? I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"mean, it doesn’t require genius?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“But I prefer to do the work myself; it makes life so much more,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"peaceful. . . . Run along, Adrian darling, and get ready for school.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh no, that’s not it!” Reginald pretended to smile. “You do the work",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"yourself, because, for some extraordinary reason, you love to humiliate",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"me. Objectively, you may not know that, but, subjectively, it’s the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,case.” This last remark so delighted him that he cut open an envelope,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"the outer door close upon Adrian and his wife. Of course, if this went",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on, he would have to make some other arrangement. That was obvious.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Tied and bound like this, how could he help the world to escape from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,life? He opened the piano and looked up his pupils for the morning.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Miss Betty Brittle, the Countess Wilkowska and Miss Marian Morrow. They",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were charming, all three.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Punctually at half-past ten the door-bell rang. He went to the door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Miss Betty Brittle was there, dressed in white, with her music in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,blue silk case.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’m afraid I’m early,” she said, blushing and shy, and she opened her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,big blue eyes very wide. “Am I?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not at all, dear lady. I am only too charmed,” said Reginald. “Won’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you come in?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s such a heavenly morning,” said Miss Brittle. “I walked across the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Well, think about them while you sing your exercises,” said Reginald,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sitting down at the piano. “It will give your voice colour and warmth.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Oh, what an enchanting idea! What a _genius_ Mr. Peacock was. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"parted her pretty lips, and began to sing like a pansy.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very good, very good, indeed,” said Reginald, playing chords that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,would waft a hardened criminal to heaven. “Make the notes round. Don’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"be afraid. Linger over them, breathe them like a perfume.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"How pretty she looked, standing there in her white frock, her little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"blonde head tilted, showing her milky throat.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Do you ever practise before a glass?” asked Reginald. “You ought to,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you know; it makes the lips more flexible. Come over here.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They went over to the mirror and stood side by side.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Now sing—moo-e-koo-e-oo-e-a!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But she broke down, and blushed more brightly than ever.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh,” she cried, “I can’t. It makes me feel so silly. It makes me want",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to laugh. I do look so absurd!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, you don’t. Don’t be afraid,” said Reginald, but laughed, too, very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"kindly. “Now, try again!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The lesson simply flew, and Betty Brittle quite got over her shyness.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“When can I come again?” she asked, tying the music up again in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"blue silk case. “I want to take as many lessons as I can just now. Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Mr. Peacock, I _do_ enjoy them so much. May I come the day after",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to-morrow?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Dear lady, I shall be only too charmed,” said Reginald, bowing her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Glorious girl! And when they had stood in front of the mirror, her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"white sleeve had just touched his black one. He could feel—yes, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"could actually feel a warm glowing spot, and he stroked it. She loved",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her lessons. His wife came in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Reginald, can you let me have some money? I must pay the dairy. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, you know I’m singing at Lord Timbuck’s at half-past nine. Can you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Yes. And the money, Reginald. It’s eight and sixpence.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Surely that’s very heavy—isn’t it?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, it’s just what it ought to be. And Adrian must have milk.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There she was—off again. Now she was standing up for Adrian against,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I have not the slightest desire to deny my child a proper amount of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"milk,” said he. “Here is ten shillings.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The door-bell rang. He went to the door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh,” said the Countess Wilkowska, “the stairs. I have not a breath.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And she put her hand over her heart as she followed him into the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"music-room. She was all in black, with a little black hat with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,floating veil—violets in her bosom.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Do not make me sing exercises, to-day,” she cried, throwing out her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hands in her delightful foreign way. “No, to-day, I want only to sing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,songs. . . . And may I take off my violets? They fade so soon.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“They fade so soon—they fade so soon,” played Reginald on the piano.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“May I put them here?” asked the Countess, dropping them in a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Dear lady, I should be only too charmed!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She began to sing, and all was well until she came to the phrase: “You",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"love me. Yes, I _know_ you love me!” Down dropped his hands from the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"keyboard, he wheeled round, facing her.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, no; that’s not good enough. You can do better than that,” cried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Reginald ardently. “You must sing as if you were in love. Listen; let,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,me try and show you.” And he sang.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes, yes. I see what you mean,” stammered the little Countess.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“May I try it again?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Certainly. Do not be afraid. Let yourself go. Confess yourself. Make,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,proud surrender!” he called above the music. And she sang.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Yes; better that time. But I still feel you are capable of more. Try,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it with me. There must be a kind of exultant defiance as well—don’t you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,feel?” And they sang together. Ah! now she was sure she understood.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“May I try once again?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You love me. Yes, I _know_ you love me.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The lesson was over before that phrase was quite perfect. The little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“And you are forgetting your violets,” said Reginald softly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“And you will come to my house on Sunday and make music?” she asked.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,Why need ye flow so fast?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sang Miss Marian Morrow, but her eyes filled with tears and her chin",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,trembled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Don’t sing just now,” said Reginald. “Let me play it for you.” He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,played so softly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Is there anything the matter?” asked Reginald. “You’re not quite happy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,this morning.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"No, she wasn’t; she was awfully miserable.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,“You don’t care to tell me what it is?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It really was nothing particular. She had those moods sometimes when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, I know,” he said; “if I could only help!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But you do; you do! Oh, if it were not for my lessons I don’t feel I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Sit down in the arm-chair and smell the violets and let me sing to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Why weren’t all men like Mr. Peacock?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I wrote a poem after the concert last night—just about what I felt. Of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,By the end of the afternoon he was quite tired and lay down on a sofa,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to rest his voice before dressing. The door of his room was open. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could hear Adrian and his wife talking in the dining-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Do you know what that teapot reminds me of, Mummy? It reminds me of a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Does it, Mr. Absurdity?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Reginald dozed. The telephone bell woke him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"“Ænone Fell is speaking. Mr. Peacock, I have just heard that you are",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"singing at Lord Timbuck’s to-night. Will you dine with me, and we can",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,go on together afterwards?” And the words of his reply dropped like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flowers down the telephone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Dear lady, I should be only too charmed.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What a triumphant evening! The little dinner _tête-à-tête_ with Ænone,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Fell, the drive to Lord Timbuck’s in her white motor-car, when she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thanked him again for the unforgettable joy. Triumph upon triumph! And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Lord Timbuck’s champagne simply flowed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Have some more champagne, Peacock,” said Lord Timbuck. Peacock, you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"notice—not Mr. Peacock—but Peacock, as if he were one of them. And",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wasn’t he? He was an artist. He could sway them all. And wasn’t he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"teaching them all to escape from life? How he sang! And as he sang, as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in a dream he saw their feathers and their flowers and their fans,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"offered to him, laid before him, like a huge bouquet.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Have another glass of wine, Peacock.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I could have any one I liked by lifting a finger,” thought Peacock,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,positively staggering home.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But as he let himself into the dark flat his marvellous sense of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,elation began to ebb away. He turned up the light in the bedroom. His,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wife lay asleep, squeezed over to her side of the bed. He remembered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,suddenly how she had said when he had told her he was going out to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dinner: “You might have let me know before!” And how he had answered:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Can’t you possibly speak to me without offending against even good,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"manners?” It was incredible, he thought, that she cared so little for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him—incredible that she wasn’t interested in the slightest in his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,triumphs and his artistic career. When so many women in her place would,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"have given their eyes. . . . Yes, he knew it. . . . Why not acknowledge",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it? . . . And there she lay, an enemy, even in her sleep. . . . Must it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ever be thus? he thought, the champagne still working. Ah, if we only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were friends, how much I could tell her now! About this evening; even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"about Timbuck’s manner to me, and all that they said to me and so on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and so on. If only I felt that she was here to come back to—that I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could confide in her—and so on and so on.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,In his emotion he pulled off his evening boot and simply hurled it in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the corner. The noise woke his wife with a terrible start. She sat up,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pushing back her hair. And he suddenly decided to have one more try to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"treat her as a friend, to tell her everything, to win her. Down he sat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on the side of the bed, and seized one of her hands. But of all those",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"splendid things he had to say, not one could he utter. For some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fiendish reason, the only words he could get out were: “Dear lady, I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,should be so charmed—so charmed!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Sun and Moon,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In the afternoon the chairs came, a whole big cart full of little gold",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ones with their legs in the air. And then the flowers came. When you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stared down from the balcony at the people carrying them the flower,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pots looked like funny awfully nice hats nodding up the path.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Moon thought they were hats. She said: “Look. There’s a man wearing a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,palm on his head.” But she never knew the difference between real,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,things and not real ones.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,There was nobody to look after Sun and Moon. Nurse was helping Annie,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,alter Mother’s dress which was much-too-long-and-tight-under-the-arms,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and Mother was running all over the house and telephoning Father to be,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sure not to forget things. She only had time to say: “Out of my way,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,children!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They kept out of her way—at any rate Sun did. He did so hate being sent,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stumping back to the nursery. It didn’t matter about Moon. If she got,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tangled in people’s legs they only threw her up and shook her till she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,squeaked. But Sun was too heavy for that. He was so heavy that the fat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"man who came to dinner on Sundays used to say: “Now, young man, let’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,try to lift you.” And then he’d put his thumbs under Sun’s arms and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,groan and try and give it up at last saying: “He’s a perfect little ton,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of bricks!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Nearly all the furniture was taken out of the dining-room. The big,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,piano was put in a corner and then there came a row of flower pots and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,then there came the goldy chairs. That was for the concert. When Sun,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"looked in a white faced man sat at the piano—not playing, but banging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,at it and then looking inside. He had a bag of tools on the piano and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he had stuck his hat on a statue against the wall. Sometimes he just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,started to play and then he jumped up again and looked inside. Sun,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hoped he wasn’t the concert.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But of course the place to be in was the kitchen. There was a man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"helping in a cap like a blancmange, and their real cook, Minnie, was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all red in the face and laughing. Not cross at all. She gave them each,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,an almond finger and lifted them up on to the flour bin so that they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could watch the wonderful things she and the man were making for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,supper. Cook brought in the things and he put them on dishes and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"trimmed them. Whole fishes, with their heads and eyes and tails still",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on, he sprinkled with red and green and yellow bits; he made squiggles",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"all over the jellies, he stuck a collar on a ham and put a very thin",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sort of a fork in it; he dotted almonds and tiny round biscuits on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,creams. And more and more things coming.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, but you haven’t seen the ice pudding,” said Cook. “Come along.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Why was she being so nice, thought Sun as she gave them each a hand.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And they looked into the refrigerator.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Oh! Oh! Oh! It was a little house. It was a little pink house with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white snow on the roof and green windows and a brown door and stuck in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the door there was a nut for a handle.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When Sun saw the nut he felt quite tired and had to lean against Cook.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Let me touch it. Just let me put my finger on the roof,” said Moon,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dancing. She always wanted to touch all the food. Sun didn’t.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Now, my girl, look sharp with the table,” said Cook as the housemaid",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,came in.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s a picture, Min,” said Nellie. “Come along and have a look.” So",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,they all went into the dining-room. Sun and Moon were almost,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,frightened. They wouldn’t go up to the table at first; they just stood,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,at the door and made eyes at it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It wasn’t real night yet but the blinds were down in the dining-room,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and the lights turned on—and all the lights were red roses. Red ribbons,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and bunches of roses tied up the table at the corners. In the middle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was a lake with rose petals floating on it.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That’s where the ice pudding is to be,” said Cook.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Two silver lions with wings had fruit on their backs, and the salt",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cellars were tiny birds drinking out of basins.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And all the winking glasses and shining plates and sparkling knives and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forks—and all the food. And the little red table napkins made into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,roses. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Are people going to eat the food?” asked Sun.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I should just think they were,” laughed Cook, laughing with Nellie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Moon laughed, too; she always did the same as other people. But Sun",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,didn’t want to laugh. Round and round he walked with his hands behind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,his back. Perhaps he never would have stopped if Nurse hadn’t called,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"suddenly: “Now then, children. It’s high time you were washed and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dressed.” And they were marched off to the nursery.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,While they were being unbuttoned Mother looked in with a white thing,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,over her shoulders; she was rubbing stuff on her face.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’ll ring for them when I want them, Nurse, and then they can just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"come down and be seen and go back again,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sun was undressed, first nearly to his skin, and dressed again in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"white shirt with red and white daisies speckled on it, breeches with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"strings at the sides and braces that came over, white socks and red",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shoes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Now you’re in your Russian costume,” said Nurse, flattening down his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fringe.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Am I?” said Sun.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Yes. Sit quiet in that chair and watch your little sister.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Moon took ages. When she had her socks put on she pretended to fall,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"back on the bed and waved her legs at Nurse as she always did, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,every time Nurse tried to make her curls with a finger and a wet brush,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she turned round and asked Nurse to show her the photo of her brooch or,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,something like that. But at last she was finished too. Her dress stuck,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"out, with fur on it, all white; there was even fluffy stuff on the legs",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of her drawers. Her shoes were white with big blobs on them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“There you are, my lamb,” said Nurse. “And you look like a sweet little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cherub of a picture of a powder-puff?” Nurse rushed to the door.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ma’am, one moment.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Mother came in again with half her hair down.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh,” she cried. “What a picture!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Isn’t she,” said Nurse.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And Moon held out her skirts by the tips and dragged one of her feet.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Sun didn’t mind people not noticing him—much. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,After that they played clean tidy games up at the table while Nurse,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stood at the door, and when the carriages began to come and the sound",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of laughter and voices and soft rustlings came from down below she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"whispered: “Now then, children, stay where you are.” Moon kept jerking",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the table cloth so that it all hung down her side and Sun hadn’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,any—and then she pretended she didn’t do it on purpose.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"At last the bell rang. Nurse pounced at them with the hair brush,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flattened his fringe, made her bow stand on end and joined their hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,together.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Down you go!” she whispered.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And down they went. Sun did feel silly holding Moon’s hand like that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,but Moon seemed to like it. She swung her arm and the bell on her coral,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bracelet jingled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,At the drawing-room door stood Mother fanning herself with a black fan.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The drawing-room was full of sweet smelling, silky, rustling ladies and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,men in black with funny tails on their coats—like beetles. Father was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"among them, talking very loud, and rattling something in his pocket.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“What a picture!” cried the ladies. “Oh, the ducks! Oh, the lambs! Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the sweets! Oh, the pets!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"All the people who couldn’t get at Moon kissed Sun, and a skinny old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lady with teeth that clicked said: “Such a serious little poppet,” and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,rapped him on the head with something hard.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sun looked to see if the same concert was there, but he was gone.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Instead, a fat man with a pink head leaned over the piano talking to a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,girl who held a violin at her ear.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"There was only one man that Sun really liked. He was a little grey man,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with long grey whiskers, who walked about by himself. He came up to Sun",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and rolled his eyes in a very nice way and said: “Hullo, my lad.” Then",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he went away. But soon he came back again and said: “Fond of dogs?” Sun,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"said: “Yes.” But then he went away again, and though Sun looked for him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,everywhere he couldn’t find him. He thought perhaps he’d gone outside,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to fetch in a puppy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Good night, my precious babies,” said Mother, folding them up in her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bare arms. “Fly up to your little nest.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Then Moon went and made a silly of herself again. She put up her arms,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in front of everybody and said: “My Daddy must carry me.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But they seemed to like it, and Daddy swooped down and picked her up as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he always did.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Nurse was in such a hurry to get them to bed that she even interrupted,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sun over his prayers and said: “Get on with them, child, _do._” And the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,moment after they were in bed and in the dark except for the nightlight,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in its little saucer.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Are you asleep?” asked Moon.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No,” said Sun. “Are you?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No,” said Moon.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"A long while after Sun woke up again. There was a loud, loud noise of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"clapping from downstairs, like when it rains. He heard Moon turn over.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Moon, are you awake?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, are you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes. Well, let’s go and look over the stairs.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They had just got settled on the top step when the drawing-room door,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,opened and they heard the party cross over the hall into the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dining-room. Then that door was shut; there was a noise of “pops” and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,laughing. Then that stopped and Sun saw them all walking round and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round the lovely table with their hands behind their backs like he had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"done. . . . Round and round they walked, looking and staring. The man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with the grey whiskers liked the little house best. When he saw the nut,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,for a handle he rolled his eyes like he did before and said to Sun:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Seen the nut?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Don’t nod your head like that, Moon.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I’m not nodding. It’s you.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“It is not. I never nod my head.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“O-oh, you do. You’re nodding it now.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I’m not. I’m only showing you how not to do it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"When they woke up again they could only hear Father’s voice very loud,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and Mother, laughing away. Father came out of the dining-room, bounded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"up the stairs, and nearly fell over them.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Hullo!” he said. “By Jove, Kitty, come and look at this.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Mother came out. “Oh, you naughty children,” said she from the hall.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Let’s have ’em down and give ’em a bone,” said Father. Sun had never",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seen him so jolly.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, certainly not,” said Mother.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, my Daddy, do! Do have us down,” said Moon.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’m hanged if I won’t,” cried Father. “I won’t be bullied. Kitty—way",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there.” And he caught them up, one under each arm.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Sun thought Mother would have been dreadfully cross. But she wasn’t.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She kept on laughing at Father.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, you dreadful boy!” said she. But she didn’t mean Sun.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Come on, kiddies. Come and have some pickings,” said this jolly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Father. But Moon stopped a minute.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Mother—your dress is right off one side.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Is it?” said Mother. And Father said “Yes” and pretended to bite her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"white shoulder, but she pushed him away.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And so they went back to the beautiful dining-room.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But—oh! oh! what had happened. The ribbons and the roses were all,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pulled untied. The little red table napkins lay on the floor, all the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shining plates were dirty and all the winking glasses. The lovely food,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that the man had trimmed was all thrown about, and there were bones and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bits and fruit peels and shells everywhere. There was even a bottle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lying down with stuff coming out of it on to the cloth and nobody stood,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it up again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And the little pink house with the snow roof and the green windows was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,broken—broken—half melted away in the centre of the table.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Come on, Sun,” said Father, pretending not to notice.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Moon lifted up her pyjama legs and shuffled up to the table and stood,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on a chair, squeaking away.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Have a bit of this ice,” said Father, smashing in some more of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,roof.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Mother took a little plate and held it for him; she put her other arm,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round his neck.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Daddy. Daddy,” shrieked Moon. “The little handle’s left. The little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nut. Kin I eat it?” And she reached across and picked it out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"door and scrunched it up, biting hard and blinking.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Here, my lad,” said Father.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But Sun did not move from the door. Suddenly he put up his head and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,gave a loud wail.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I think it’s horrid—horrid—horrid!” he sobbed.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"nearly screamed, and burned to throw something enormous after him when",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,he did finally blush his way out—something like the tortoise stove. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,strange thing was that at first sight he looked most interesting.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Everybody agreed about that. You would drift into the café one evening,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and there you would see, sitting in a corner, with a glass of coffee in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"front of him, a thin, dark boy, wearing a blue jersey with a little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,grey flannel jacket buttoned over it. And somehow that blue jersey and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the grey jacket with the sleeves that were too short gave him the air,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of a boy that has made up his mind to run away to sea. Who has run,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"away, in fact, and will get up in a moment and sling a knotted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,handkerchief containing his nightshirt and his mother’s picture on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"could one resist him? Oh, one’s heart was wrung at sight. And, as if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that were not enough, there was his trick of blushing. . . . Whenever",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"too thrilling for words, where you sat in the most awful gloom, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,like a “Broken Doll.” But when she took him back to his studio he had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"all the year round, and where the concierge lives in a glass cage on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the ground floor, wrapped up in a filthy shawl, stirring something in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,saucepan and ladling out tit-bits to the swollen old dog lolling on a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bead cushion. . . . Perched up in the air the studio had a wonderful,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,view. The two big windows faced the water; he could see the boats and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the barges swinging up and down, and the fringe of an island planted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with trees, like a round bouquet. The side window looked across to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"another house, shabbier still and smaller, and down below there was a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flower market. You could see the tops of huge umbrellas, with frills of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bright flowers escaping from them, booths covered with striped awning",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,where they sold plants in boxes and clumps of wet gleaming palms in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,terra-cotta jars. Among the flowers the old women scuttled from side to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"side, like crabs. Really there was no need for him to go out. If he sat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,"exceed this amount for next month. Signed, Ian French.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Nothing very fishy about this; but those far-seeing women were quite,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,right. It wasn’t all.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,One evening he was sitting at the side window eating some prunes and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,throwing the stones on to the tops of the huge umbrellas in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,deserted flower market. It had been raining—the first real spring rain,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of the year had fallen—a bright spangle hung on everything, and the air",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,smelled of buds and moist earth. Many voices sounding languid and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"content rang out in the dusky air, and the people who had come to close",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,their windows and fasten the shutters leaned out instead. Down below in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the market the trees were peppered with new green. What kind of trees,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were they? he wondered. And now came the lamplighter. He stared at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"house across the way, the small, shabby house, and suddenly, as if in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"answer to his gaze, two wings of windows opened and a girl came out on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to the tiny balcony carrying a pot of daffodils. She was a strangely,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"thin girl in a dark pinafore, with a pink handkerchief tied over her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hair. Her sleeves were rolled up almost to her shoulders and her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,slender arms shone against the dark stuff.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, it is quite warm enough. It will do them good,” she said, putting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,down the pot and turning to some one in the room inside. As she turned,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she put her hands up to the handkerchief and tucked away some wisps of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hair. She looked down at the deserted market and up at the sky, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,where he sat there might have been a hollow in the air. She simply did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,not see the house opposite. And then she disappeared.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"His heart fell out of the side window of his studio, and down to the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,balcony of the house opposite—buried itself in the pot of daffodils,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,under the half-opened buds and spears of green. . . . That room with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the balcony was the sitting-room, and the one next door to it was the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kitchen. He heard the clatter of the dishes as she washed up after,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"supper, and then she came to the window, knocked a little mop against",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the ledge, and hung it on a nail to dry. She never sang or unbraided",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her hair, or held out her arms to the moon as young girls are supposed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to do. And she always wore the same dark pinafore and the pink,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,handkerchief over her hair. . . . Whom did she live with? Nobody else,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"came to those two windows, and yet she was always talking to some one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in the room. Her mother, he decided, was an invalid. They took in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sewing. The father was dead. . . . He had been a journalist—very pale,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with long moustaches, and a piece of black hair falling over his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forehead.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"By working all day they just made enough money to live on, but they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,never went out and they had no friends. Now when he sat down at his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,table he had to make an entirely new set of sworn statements. . . . Not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to go to the side window before a certain hour: signed, Ian French. Not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to think about her until he had put away his painting things for the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"day: signed, Ian French.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was quite simple. She was the only person he really wanted to know,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"because she was, he decided, the only other person alive who was just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his age. He couldn’t stand giggling girls, and he had no use for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"grown-up women. . . . She was his age, she was—well, just like him. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sat in his dusky studio, tired, with one arm hanging over the back of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his chair, staring in at her window and seeing himself in there with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her. She had a violent temper; they quarrelled terribly at times, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and she. She had a way of stamping her foot and twisting her hands in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her pinafore . . . furious. And she very rarely laughed. Only when she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,told him about an absurd little kitten she once had who used to roar,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and pretend to be a lion when it was given meat to eat. Things like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that made her laugh. . . . But as a rule they sat together very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"quietly; he, just as he was sitting now, and she with her hands folded",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in her lap and her feet tucked under, talking in low tones, or silent",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and tired after the day’s work. Of course, she never asked him about",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his pictures, and of course he made the most wonderful drawings of her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"which she hated, because he made her so thin and so dark. . . . But how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could he get to know her? This might go on for years. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Then he discovered that once a week, in the evenings, she went out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shopping. On two successive Thursdays she came to the window wearing an,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"old-fashioned cape over the pinafore, and carrying a basket. From where",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"he sat he could not see the door of her house, but on the next Thursday",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,evening at the same time he snatched up his cap and ran down the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stairs. There was a lovely pink light over everything. He saw it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"glowing in the river, and the people walking towards him had pink faces",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and pink hands.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He leaned against the side of his house waiting for her and he had no,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"idea of what he was going to do or say. “Here she comes,” said a voice",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in his head. She walked very quickly, with small, light steps; with one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hand she carried the basket, with the other she kept the cape together.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,. . . What could he do? He could only follow. . . . First she went into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the grocer’s and spent a long time in there, and then she went into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,butcher’s where she had to wait her turn. Then she was an age at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"draper’s matching something, and then she went to the fruit shop and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bought a lemon. As he watched her he knew more surely than ever he must,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"get to know her, now. Her composure, her seriousness and her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"loneliness, the very way she walked as though she was eager to be done",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with this world of grown-ups all was so natural to him and so,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,inevitable.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, she is always like that,” he thought proudly. “We have nothing to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,do with these people.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But now she was on her way home and he was as far off as ever. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She suddenly turned into the dairy and he saw her through the window,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,buying an egg. She picked it out of the basket with such care—a brown,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"one, a beautifully shaped one, the one he would have chosen. And when",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she came out of the dairy he went in after her. In a moment he was out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"again, and following her past his house across the flower market,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dodging among the huge umbrellas and treading on the fallen flowers and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the round marks where the pots had stood. . . . Through her door he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"crept, and up the stairs after, taking care to tread in time with her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"so that she should not notice. Finally, she stopped on the landing, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,took the key out of her purse. As she put it into the door he ran up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and faced her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Blushing more crimson than ever, but looking at her severely he said,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"almost angrily: “Excuse me, Mademoiselle, you dropped this.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And he handed her an egg.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,A Dill Pickle,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And then, after six years, she saw him again. He was seated at one of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,those little bamboo tables decorated with a Japanese vase of paper,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"daffodils. There was a tall plate of fruit in front of him, and very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"carefully, in a way she recognized immediately as his “special” way, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was peeling an orange.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He must have felt that shock of recognition in her for he looked up and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,met her eyes. Incredible! He didn’t know her! She smiled; he frowned.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She came towards him. He closed his eyes an instant, but opening them",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,his face lit up as though he had struck a match in a dark room. He laid,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"down the orange and pushed back his chair, and she took her little warm",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hand out of her muff and gave it to him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Vera!” he exclaimed. “How strange. Really, for a moment I didn’t know",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you. Won’t you sit down? You’ve had lunch? Won’t you have some coffee?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She hesitated, but of course she meant to.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I’d like some coffee.” And she sat down opposite him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You’ve changed. You’ve changed very much,” he said, staring at her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with that eager, lighted look. “You look so well. I’ve never seen you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,look so well before.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Really?” She raised her veil and unbuttoned her high fur collar. “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"don’t feel very well. I can’t bear this weather, you know.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, no. You hate the cold. . . .”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Loathe it.” She shuddered. “And the worst of it is that the older one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,grows . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He interrupted her. “Excuse me,” and tapped on the table for the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,waitress. “Please bring some coffee and cream.” To her: “You are sure,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"you won’t eat anything? Some fruit, perhaps. The fruit here is very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,good.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, thanks. Nothing.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Then that’s settled.” And smiling just a hint too broadly he took up,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the orange again. “You were saying—the older one grows——”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“The colder,” she laughed. But she was thinking how well she remembered",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that trick of his—the trick of interrupting her—and of how it used to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"exasperate her six years ago. She used to feel then as though he, quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"suddenly, in the middle of what she was saying, put his hand over her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lips, turned from her, attended to something different, and then took",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his hand away, and with just the same slightly too broad smile, gave",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her his attention again. . . . Now we are ready. That is settled.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“The colder!” He echoed her words, laughing too. “Ah, ah. You still say",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the same things. And there is another thing about you that is not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,changed at all—your beautiful voice—your beautiful way of speaking.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Now he was very grave; he leaned towards her, and she smelled the warm,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stinging scent of the orange peel. “You have only to say one word and I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,would know your voice among all other voices. I don’t know what it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,is—I’ve often wondered—that makes your voice such a—haunting memory. Do,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you remember that first afternoon we spent together at Kew Gardens? You,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were so surprised because I did not know the names of any flowers. I am,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,still just as ignorant for all your telling me. But whenever it is very,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fine and warm, and I see some bright colours—it’s awfully strange—I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hear your voice saying: ‘Geranium, marigold and verbena.’ And I feel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"those three words are all I recall of some forgotten, heavenly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,language. . . . You remember that afternoon?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes, very well.” She drew a long, soft breath, as though the paper",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"daffodils between them were almost too sweet to bear. Yet, what had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,remained in her mind of that particular afternoon was an absurd scene,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"over the tea table. A great many people taking tea in a Chinese pagoda,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and he behaving like a maniac about the wasps—waving them away,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flapping at them with his straw hat, serious and infuriated out of all",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,proportion to the occasion. How delighted the sniggering tea drinkers,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had been. And how she had suffered.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But now, as he spoke, that memory faded. His was the truer. Yes, it had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"been a wonderful afternoon, full of geranium and marigold and verbena,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and—warm sunshine. Her thoughts lingered over the last two words as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,though she sang them.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"In the warmth, as it were, another memory unfolded. She saw herself",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sitting on a lawn. He lay beside her, and suddenly, after a long",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"silence, he rolled over and put his head in her lap.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I wish,” he said, in a low, troubled voice, “I wish that I had taken",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,poison and were about to die—here now!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"At that moment a little girl in a white dress, holding a long, dripping",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"water lily, dodged from behind a bush, stared at them, and dodged back",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again. But he did not see. She leaned over him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, why do you say that? I could not say that.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But he gave a kind of soft moan, and taking her hand he held it to his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cheek.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Because I know I am going to love you too much—far too much. And I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shall suffer so terribly. Vera, because you never, never will love me.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He was certainly far better looking now than he had been then. He had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lost all that dreamy vagueness and indecision. Now he had the air of a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"man who has found his place in life, and fills it with a confidence and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"an assurance which was, to say the least, impressive. He must have made",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"money, too. His clothes were admirable, and at that moment he pulled a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Russian cigarette case out of his pocket.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Won’t you smoke?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I will.” She hovered over them. “They look very good.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I think they are. I get them made for me by a little man in St.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,James’s Street. I don’t smoke very much. I’m not like you—but when I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"do, they must be delicious, very fresh cigarettes. Smoking isn’t a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,habit with me; it’s a luxury—like perfume. Are you still so fond of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"perfumes? Ah, when I was in Russia . . .”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She broke in: “You’ve really been to Russia?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, yes. I was there for over a year. Have you forgotten how we used",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to talk of going there?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, I’ve not forgotten.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He gave a strange half laugh and leaned back in his chair. “Isn’t it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,curious. I have really carried out all those journeys that we planned.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Yes, I have been to all those places that we talked of, and stayed in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them long enough to—as you used to say, ‘air oneself’ in them. In fact,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,I have spent the last three years of my life travelling all the time.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Spain, Corsica, Siberia, Russia, Egypt. The only country left is China,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and I mean to go there, too, when the war is over.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"As he spoke, so lightly, tapping the end of his cigarette against the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ash-tray, she felt the strange beast that had slumbered so long within",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her bosom stir, stretch itself, yawn, prick up its ears, and suddenly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bound to its feet, and fix its longing, hungry stare upon those far",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"away places. But all she said was, smiling gently: “How I envy you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He accepted that. “It has been,” he said, “very wonderful—especially",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Russia. Russia was all that we had imagined, and far, far more. I even",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,spent some days on a river boat on the Volga. Do you remember that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,boatman’s song that you used to play?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Yes.” It began to play in her mind as she spoke.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Do you ever play it now?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, I’ve no piano.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,He was amazed at that. “But what has become of your beautiful piano?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She made a little grimace. “Sold. Ages ago.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But you were so fond of music,” he wondered.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I’ve no time for it now,” said she.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He let it go at that. “That river life,” he went on, “is something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,quite special. After a day or two you cannot realize that you have ever,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,known another. And it is not necessary to know the language—the life of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the boat creates a bond between you and the people that’s more than,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sufficient. You eat with them, pass the day with them, and in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,evening there is that endless singing.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She shivered, hearing the boatman’s song break out again loud and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tragic, and seeing the boat floating on the darkening river with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"melancholy trees on either side. . . . “Yes, I should like that,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she, stroking her muff.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“You’d like almost everything about Russian life,” he said warmly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s so informal, so impulsive, so free without question. And then the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"peasants are so splendid. They are such human beings—yes, that is it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Even the man who drives your carriage has—has some real part in what is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"happening. I remember the evening a party of us, two friends of mine",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and the wife of one of them, went for a picnic by the Black Sea. We",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,took supper and champagne and ate and drank on the grass. And while we,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"were eating the coachman came up. ‘Have a dill pickle,’ he said. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wanted to share with us. That seemed to me so right, so—you know what I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mean?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And she seemed at that moment to be sitting on the grass beside the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"mysteriously Black Sea, black as velvet, and rippling against the banks",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in silent, velvet waves. She saw the carriage drawn up to one side of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the road, and the little group on the grass, their faces and hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white in the moonlight. She saw the pale dress of the woman outspread,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and her folded parasol, lying on the grass like a huge pearl crochet",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hook. Apart from them, with his supper in a cloth on his knees, sat the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"coachman. “Have a dill pickle,” said he, and although she was not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"certain what a dill pickle was, she saw the greenish glass jar with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,red chili like a parrot’s beak glimmering through. She sucked in her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cheeks; the dill pickle was terribly sour. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I know perfectly what you mean,” she said.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,In the pause that followed they looked at each other. In the past when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,they had looked at each other like that they had felt such a boundless,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"understanding between them that their souls had, as it were, put their",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"arms round each other and dropped into the same sea, content to be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"drowned, like mournful lovers. But now, the surprising thing was that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it was he who held back. He who said:,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What a marvellous listener you are. When you look at me with those,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wild eyes I feel that I could tell you things that I would never,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,breathe to another human being.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Was there just a hint of mockery in his voice or was it her fancy? She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could not be sure.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Before I met you,” he said, “I had never spoken of myself to anybody.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"How well I remember one night, the night that I brought you the little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Christmas tree, telling you all about my childhood. And of how I was so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,miserable that I ran away and lived under a cart in our yard for two,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"days without being discovered. And you listened, and your eyes shone,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and I felt that you had even made the little Christmas tree listen too,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,as in a fairy story.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But of that evening she had remembered a little pot of caviare. It had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cost seven and sixpence. He could not get over it. Think of it—a tiny,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,jar like that costing seven and sixpence. While she ate it he watched,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her, delighted and shocked.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, really, that is eating money. You could not get seven shillings",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,into a little pot that size. Only think of the profit they must make. .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,. .” And he had begun some immensely complicated calculations. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But now good-bye to the caviare. The Christmas tree was on the table,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and the little boy lay under the cart with his head pillowed on the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,yard dog.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“The dog was called Bosun,” she cried delightedly.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But he did not follow. “Which dog? Had you a dog? I don’t remember a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,dog at all.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“No, no. I mean the yard dog when you were a little boy.” He laughed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and snapped the cigarette case to.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Was he? Do you know I had forgotten that. It seems such ages ago. I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cannot believe that it is only six years. After I had recognized you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to-day—I had to take such a leap—I had to take a leap over my whole,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,life to get back to that time. I was such a kid then.” He drummed on,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the table. “I’ve often thought how I must have bored you. And now I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,understand so perfectly why you wrote to me as you did—although at the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,time that letter nearly finished my life. I found it again the other,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"day, and I couldn’t help laughing as I read it. It was so clever—such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,true picture of me.” He glanced up. “You’re not going?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She had buttoned her collar again and drawn down her veil.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes, I am afraid I must,” she said, and managed a smile. Now she knew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that he had been mocking.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, no, please,” he pleaded. “Don’t go just for a moment,” and he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,caught up one of her gloves from the table and clutched at it as if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that would hold her. “I see so few people to talk to nowadays, that I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"have turned into a sort of barbarian,” he said. “Have I said something",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to hurt you?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Not a bit,” she lied. But as she watched him draw her glove through",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his fingers, gently, gently, her anger really did die down, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"besides, at the moment he looked more like himself of six years ago. .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,. .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“What I really wanted then,” he said softly, “was to be a sort of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,carpet—to make myself into a sort of carpet for you to walk on so that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you need not be hurt by the sharp stones and the mud that you hated so.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was nothing more positive than that—nothing more selfish. Only I did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"desire, eventually, to turn into a magic carpet and carry you away to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all those lands you longed to see.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,As he spoke she lifted her head as though she drank something; the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,strange beast in her bosom began to purr. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I felt that you were more lonely than anybody else in the world,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"went on, “and yet, perhaps, that you were the only person in the world",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"who was really, truly alive. Born out of your time,” he murmured,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stroking the glove, “fated.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Ah, God! What had she done! How had she dared to throw away her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,happiness like this. This was the only man who had ever understood her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Was it too late? Could it be too late? _She_ was that glove that he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,held in his fingers. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“And then the fact that you had no friends and never had made friends,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with people. How I understood that, for neither had I. Is it just the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,same now?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Yes,” she breathed. “Just the same. I am as alone as ever.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“So am I,” he laughed gently, “just the same.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Suddenly with a quick gesture he handed her back the glove and scraped,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his chair on the floor, “But what seemed to me so mysterious then is",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"perfectly plain to me now. And to you, too, of course. . . . It simply",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was that we were such egoists, so self-engrossed, so wrapped up in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ourselves that we hadn’t a corner in our hearts for anybody else. Do,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"you know,” he cried, naive and hearty, and dreadfully like another side",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of that old self again, “I began studying a Mind System when I was in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Russia, and I found that we were not peculiar at all. It’s quite a well",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,known form of . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She had gone. He sat there, thunder-struck, astounded beyond words. . .",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,. And then he asked the waitress for his bill.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But the cream has not been touched,” he said. “Please do not charge me",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,for it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,The Little Governess,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Oh, dear, how she wished that it wasn’t night-time. She’d have much",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"rather travelled by day, much much rather. But the lady at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Governess Bureau had said: “You had better take an evening boat and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,then if you get into a compartment for ‘Ladies Only’ in the train you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,will be far safer than sleeping in a foreign hotel. Don’t go out of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,carriage; don’t walk about the corridors and _be sure_ to lock the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lavatory door if you go there. The train arrives at Munich at eight,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"o’clock, and Frau Arnholdt says that the Hotel Grunewald is only one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,minute away. A porter can take you there. She will arrive at six the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"same evening, so you will have a nice quiet day to rest after the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,journey and rub up your German. And when you want anything to eat I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,would advise you to pop into the nearest baker’s and get a bun and some,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"coffee. You haven’t been abroad before, have you?” “No.” “Well, I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,always tell my girls that it’s better to mistrust people at first,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"rather than trust them, and it’s safer to suspect people of evil",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,intentions rather than good ones. . . . It sounds rather hard but we’ve,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"got to be women of the world, haven’t we?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It had been nice in the Ladies’ Cabin. The stewardess was so kind and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,changed her money for her and tucked up her feet. She lay on one of the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hard pink-sprigged couches and watched the other passengers, friendly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and natural, pinning their hats to the bolsters, taking off their boots",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and skirts, opening dressing-cases and arranging mysterious rustling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"little packages, tying their heads up in veils before lying down.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"_Thud_, _thud_, _thud_, went the steady screw of the steamer. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stewardess pulled a green shade over the light and sat down by the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stove, her skirt turned back over her knees, a long piece of knitting",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,on her lap. On a shelf above her head there was a water-bottle with a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tight bunch of flowers stuck in it. “I like travelling very much,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thought the little governess. She smiled and yielded to the warm,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,rocking.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But when the boat stopped and she went up on deck, her dress-basket in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"one hand, her rug and umbrella in the other, a cold, strange wind flew",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,under her hat. She looked up at the masts and spars of the ship black,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,against a green glittering sky and down to the dark landing stage where,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"strange muffled figures lounged, waiting; she moved forward with the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sleepy flock, all knowing where to go to and what to do except her, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she felt afraid. Just a little—just enough to wish—oh, to wish that it",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was daytime and that one of those women who had smiled at her in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"glass, when they both did their hair in the Ladies’ Cabin, was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"somewhere near now. “Tickets, please. Show your tickets. Have your",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tickets ready.” She went down the gangway balancing herself carefully,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,on her heels. Then a man in a black leather cap came forward and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"touched her on the arm. “Where for, Miss?” He spoke English—he must be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a guard or a stationmaster with a cap like that. She had scarcely,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"answered when he pounced on her dress-basket. “This way,” he shouted,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"in a rude, determined voice, and elbowing his way he strode past the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,people. “But I don’t want a porter.” What a horrible man! “I don’t want,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a porter. I want to carry it myself.” She had to run to keep up with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"him, and her anger, far stronger than she, ran before her and snatched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the bag out of the wretch’s hand. He paid no attention at all, but",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"swung on down the long dark platform, and across a railway line. “He is",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a robber.” She was sure he was a robber as she stepped between the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,silvery rails and felt the cinders crunch under her shoes. On the other,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"side—oh, thank goodness!—there was a train with Munich written on it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The man stopped by the huge lighted carriages. “Second class?” asked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the insolent voice. “Yes, a Ladies’ compartment.” She was quite out of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,breath. She opened her little purse to find something small enough to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,give this horrible man while he tossed her dress-basket into the rack,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of an empty carriage that had a ticket, _Dames Seules_, gummed on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,window. She got into the train and handed twenty centimes. “What’s,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"this?” shouted the man, glaring at the money and then at her, holding",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"it up to his nose, sniffing at it as though he had never in his life",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seen, much less held, such a sum. “It’s a franc. You know that, don’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you? It’s a franc. That’s my fare!” A franc! Did he imagine that she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was going to give him a franc for playing a trick like that just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"because she was a girl and travelling alone at night? Never, never! She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,squeezed her purse in her hand and simply did not see him—she looked at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a view of St. Malo on the wall opposite and simply did not hear him.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Ah, no. Ah, no. Four sous. You make a mistake. Here, take it. It’s a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,franc I want.” He leapt on to the step of the train and threw the money,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on to her lap. Trembling with terror she screwed herself tight, tight,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and put out an icy hand and took the money—stowed it away in her hand.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That’s all you’re going to get,” she said. For a minute or two she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"felt his sharp eyes pricking her all over, while he nodded slowly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pulling down his mouth: “Ve-ry well. _Trrrès bien._” He shrugged his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shoulders and disappeared into the dark. Oh, the relief! How simply",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,terrible that had been! As she stood up to feel if the dress-basket was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"firm she caught sight of herself in the mirror, quite white, with big",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,round eyes. She untied her “motor veil” and unbuttoned her green cape.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But it’s all over now,” she said to the mirror face, feeling in some",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,way that it was more frightened than she.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,People began to assemble on the platform. They stood together in little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,groups talking; a strange light from the station lamps painted their,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,faces almost green. A little boy in red clattered up with a huge tea,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wagon and leaned against it, whistling and flicking his boots with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,serviette. A woman in a black alpaca apron pushed a barrow with pillows,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,for hire. Dreamy and vacant she looked—like a woman wheeling a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"perambulator—up and down, up and down—with a sleeping baby inside it.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Wreaths of white smoke floated up from somewhere and hung below the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"roof like misty vines. “How strange it all is,” thought the little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"governess, “and the middle of the night, too.” She looked out from her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"safe corner, frightened no longer but proud that she had not given that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,franc. “I can look after myself—of course I can. The great thing is not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to——” Suddenly from the corridor there came a stamping of feet and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"men’s voices, high and broken with snatches of loud laughter. They were",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,coming her way. The little governess shrank into her corner as four,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"young men in bowler hats passed, staring through the door and window.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"One of them, bursting with the joke, pointed to the notice _Dames",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Seules_ and the four bent down the better to see the one little girl in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the corner. Oh dear, they were in the carriage next door. She heard",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them tramping about and then a sudden hush followed by a tall thin,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,fellow with a tiny black moustache who flung her door open. “If,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"mademoiselle cares to come in with us,” he said, in French. She saw the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"others crowding behind him, peeping under his arm and over his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shoulder, and she sat very straight and still. “If mademoiselle will do",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"us the honour,” mocked the tall man. One of them could be quiet no",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,longer; his laughter went off in a loud crack. “Mademoiselle is,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"serious,” persisted the young man, bowing and grimacing. He took off",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his hat with a flourish, and she was alone again.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“_En voiture. En voi-ture!_” Some one ran up and down beside the train.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I wish it wasn’t night-time. I wish there was another woman in the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,carriage. I’m frightened of the men next door.” The little governess,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,looked out to see her porter coming back again—the same man making for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her carriage with his arms full of luggage. But—but what _was_ he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,doing? He put his thumb nail under the label _Dames Seules_ and tore it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,right off and then stood aside squinting at her while an old man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wrapped in a plaid cape climbed up the high step. “But this is a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ladies’ compartment.” “Oh, no, Mademoiselle, you make a mistake. No,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"no, I assure you. Merci, Monsieur.” “_En voi-turre!_” A shrill whistle.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The porter stepped off triumphant and the train started. For a moment,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,or two big tears brimmed her eyes and through them she saw the old man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,unwinding a scarf from his neck and untying the flaps of his Jaeger,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cap. He looked very old. Ninety at least. He had a white moustache and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,big gold-rimmed spectacles with little blue eyes behind them and pink,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,wrinkled cheeks. A nice face—and charming the way he bent forward and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"said in halting French: “Do I disturb you, Mademoiselle? Would you",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,rather I took all these things out of the rack and found another,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,carriage?” What! that old man have to move all those heavy things just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"because she . . . “No, it’s quite all right. You don’t disturb me at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"all.” “Ah, a thousand thanks.” He sat down opposite her and unbuttoned",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the cape of his enormous coat and flung it off his shoulders.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The train seemed glad to have left the station. With a long leap it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sprang into the dark. She rubbed a place in the window with her glove,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,but she could see nothing—just a tree outspread like a black fan or a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"scatter of lights, or the line of a hill, solemn and huge. In the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"carriage next door the young men started singing “_Un, deux, trois._”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They sang the same song over and over at the tops of their voices.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I never could have dared to go to sleep if I had been alone,” she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,decided. “_I couldn’t_ have put my feet up or even taken off my hat.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The singing gave her a queer little tremble in her stomach and, hugging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"herself to stop it, with her arms crossed under her cape, she felt",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,really glad to have the old man in the carriage with her. Careful to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,see that he was not looking she peeped at him through her long lashes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He sat extremely upright, the chest thrown out, the chin well in, knees",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pressed together, reading a German paper. That was why he spoke French",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"so funnily. He was a German. Something in the army, she supposed—a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Colonel or a General—once, of course, not now; he was too old for that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,now. How spick and span he looked for an old man. He wore a pearl pin,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stuck in his black tie and a ring with a dark red stone on his little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,finger; the tip of a white silk handkerchief showed in the pocket of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his double-breasted jacket. Somehow, altogether, he was really nice to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,look at. Most old men were so horrid. She couldn’t bear them doddery—or,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,they had a disgusting cough or something. But not having a beard—that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,made all the difference—and then his cheeks were so pink and his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,moustache so very white. Down went the German paper and the old man,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leaned forward with the same delightful courtesy: “Do you speak German,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Mademoiselle?” “_Ja, ein wenig, mehr als Franzosisch_,” said the little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"governess, blushing a deep pink colour that spread slowly over her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cheeks and made her blue eyes look almost black. “Ach, so!” The old man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bowed graciously. “Then perhaps you would care to look at some,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,illustrated papers.” He slipped a rubber band from a little roll of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them and handed them across. “Thank you very much.” She was very fond,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of looking at pictures, but first she would take off her hat and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"gloves. So she stood up, unpinned the brown straw and put it neatly in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the rack beside the dress-basket, stripped off her brown kid gloves,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,paired them in a tight roll and put them in the crown of the hat for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"safety, and then sat down again, more comfortably this time, her feet",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"crossed, the papers on her lap. How kindly the old man in the corner",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"watched her bare little hand turning over the big white pages, watched",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her lips moving as she pronounced the long words to herself, rested",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,upon her hair that fairly blazed under the light. Alas! how tragic for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,a little governess to possess hair that made one think of tangerines,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and marigolds, of apricots and tortoiseshell cats and champagne!",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Perhaps that was what the old man was thinking as he gazed and gazed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and that not even the dark ugly clothes could disguise her soft beauty.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Perhaps the flush that licked his cheeks and lips was a flush of rage,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that anyone so young and tender should have to travel alone and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,unprotected through the night. Who knows he was not murmuring in his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sentimental German fashion: “_Ja, es ist eine Tragœdie!_ Would to God I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were the child’s grandpapa!”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Thank you very much. They were very interesting.” She smiled prettily,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"handing back the papers. “But you speak German extremely well,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the old man. “You have been in Germany before, of course?” “Oh no, this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"is the first time”—a little pause, then—“this is the first time that I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,have ever been abroad at all.” “Really! I am surprised. You gave me the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"impression, if I may say so, that you were accustomed to travelling.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, well—I have been about a good deal in England, and to Scotland,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"once.” “So. I myself have been in England once, but I could not learn",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"English.” He raised one hand and shook his head, laughing. “No, it was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,too difficult for me. . . . ‘Ow-do-you-do. Please vich is ze vay to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Leicestaire Squaare.’” She laughed too. “Foreigners always say . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"They had quite a little talk about it. “But you will like Munich,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the old man. “Munich is a wonderful city. Museums, pictures, galleries,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fine buildings and shops, concerts, theatres, restaurants—all are in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Munich. I have travelled all over Europe many, many times in my life,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,but it is always to Munich that I return. You will enjoy yourself,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there.” “I am not going to _stay_ in Munich,” said the little",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"governess, and she added shyly, “I am going to a post as governess to a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"doctor’s family in Augsburg.” “Ah, that was it.” Augsburg he knew.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Augsburg—well—was not beautiful. A solid manufacturing town. But if,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Germany was new to her he hoped she would find something interesting,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,there too. “I am sure I shall.” “But what a pity not to see Munich,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before you go. You ought to take a little holiday on your way”—he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,smiled—“and store up some pleasant memories.” “I am afraid I could not,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"do _that_,” said the little governess, shaking her head, suddenly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"important and serious. “And also, if one is alone . . .” He quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"understood. He bowed, serious too. They were silent after that. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"train shattered on, baring its dark, flaming breast to the hills and to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the valleys. It was warm in the carriage. She seemed to lean against,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the dark rushing and to be carried away and away. Little sounds made,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"themselves heard; steps in the corridor, doors opening and shutting—a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,murmur of voices—whistling. . . . Then the window was pricked with long,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,needles of rain. . . . But it did not matter . . . it was outside . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and she had her umbrella . . . she pouted, sighed, opened and shut her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hands once and fell fast asleep.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Pardon! Pardon!” The sliding back of the carriage door woke her with a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,start. What had happened? Some one had come in and gone out again. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"old man sat in his corner, more upright than ever, his hands in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pockets of his coat, frowning heavily. “Ha! ha! ha!” came from the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"carriage next door. Still half asleep, she put her hands to her hair to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,make sure it wasn’t a dream. “Disgraceful!” muttered the old man more,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to himself than to her. “Common, vulgar fellows! I am afraid they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"disturbed you, gracious Fräulein, blundering in here like that.” No,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"not really. She was just going to wake up, and she took out silver",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,watch to look at the time. Half-past four. A cold blue light filled the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,window panes. Now when she rubbed a place she could see bright patches,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of fields, a clump of white houses like mushrooms, a road “like a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"picture” with poplar trees on either side, a thread of river. How",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pretty it was! How pretty and how different! Even those pink clouds in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the sky looked foreign. It was cold, but she pretended that it was far",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"colder and rubbed her hands together and shivered, pulling at the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,collar of her coat because she was so happy.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The train began to slow down. The engine gave a long shrill whistle.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"They were coming to a town. Taller houses, pink and yellow, glided by,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fast asleep behind their green eyelids, and guarded by the poplar trees",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that quivered in the blue air as if on tiptoe, listening. In one house",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a woman opened the shutters, flung a red and white mattress across the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,window frame and stood staring at the train. A pale woman with black,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hair and a white woollen shawl over her shoulders. More women appeared,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,at the doors and at the windows of the sleeping houses. There came a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flock of sheep. The shepherd wore a blue blouse and pointed wooden,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shoes. Look! look what flowers—and by the railway station too! Standard,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"roses like bridesmaids’ bouquets, white geraniums, waxy pink ones that",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,you would _never_ see out of a greenhouse at home. Slower and slower. A,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,man with a watering-can was spraying the platform. “A-a-a-ah!” Somebody,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,came running and waving his arms. A huge fat woman waddled through the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"glass doors of the station with a tray of strawberries. Oh, she was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thirsty! She was very thirsty! “A-a-a-ah!” The same somebody ran back,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again. The train stopped.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The old man pulled his coat round him and got up, smiling at her. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"murmured something she didn’t quite catch, but she smiled back at him",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,as he left the carriage. While he was away the little governess looked,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"at herself again in the glass, shook and patted herself with the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,precise practical care of a girl who is old enough to travel by herself,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and has nobody else to assure her that she is “quite all right behind.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Thirsty and thirsty! The air tasted of water. She let down the window,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and the fat woman with the strawberries passed as if on purpose;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"holding up the tray to her. “_Nein, danke,_” said the little governess,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,looking at the big berries on their gleaming leaves. “_Wie viel?_” she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"asked as the fat woman moved away. “Two marks fifty, Fräulein.” “Good",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"gracious!” She came in from the window and sat down in the corner, very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sobered for a minute. Half a crown! “H-o-o-o-o-o-e-e-e!” shrieked the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"train, gathering itself together to be off again. She hoped the old man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wouldn’t be left behind. Oh, it was daylight—everything was lovely if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"only she hadn’t been so thirsty. Where _was_ the old man—oh, here he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was—she dimpled at him as though he were an old accepted friend as he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"closed the door and, turning, took from under his cape a basket of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,strawberries. “If Fräulein would honour me by accepting these . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What for me?” But she drew back and raised her hands as though he were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,about to put a wild little kitten on her lap.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Certainly, for you,” said the old man. “For myself it is twenty years",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"since I was brave enough to eat strawberries.” “Oh, thank you very",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"much. _Danke bestens_,” she stammered, “_sie sind so sehr schön!_” “Eat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them and see,” said the old man looking pleased and friendly. “You",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"won’t have even one?” “No, no, no.” Timidly and charmingly her hand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hovered. They were so big and juicy she had to take two bites to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them—the juice ran all down her fingers—and it was while she munched,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the berries that she first thought of the old man as a grandfather.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,What a perfect grandfather he would make! Just like one out of a book!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The sun came out, the pink clouds in the sky, the strawberry clouds",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,were eaten by the blue. “Are they good?” asked the old man. “As good as,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,they look?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When she had eaten them she felt she had known him for years. She told,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him about Frau Arnholdt and how she had got the place. Did he know the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Hotel Grunewald? Frau Arnholdt would not arrive until the evening. He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"listened, listened until he knew as much about the affair as she did,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,until he said—not looking at her—but smoothing the palms of his brown,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,suède gloves together: “I wonder if you would let me show you a little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,of Munich to-day. Nothing much—but just perhaps a picture gallery and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the Englischer Garten. It seems such a pity that you should have to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"spend the day at the hotel, and also a little uncomfortable . . . in a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,strange place. _Nicht wahr?_ You would be back there by the early,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"afternoon or whenever you wish, of course, and you would give an old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,man a great deal of pleasure.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was not until long after she had said “Yes”—because the moment she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had said it and he had thanked her he began telling her about his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,travels in Turkey and attar of roses—that she wondered whether she had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"done wrong. After all, she really did not know him. But he was so old",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and he had been so very kind—not to mention the strawberries. . . . And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she couldn’t have explained the reason why she said “No,” and it was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her _last_ day in a way, her last day to really enjoy herself in. “Was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"I wrong? Was I?” A drop of sunlight fell into her hands and lay there,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"warm and quivering. “If I might accompany you as far as the hotel,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"suggested, “and call for you again at about ten o’clock.” He took out",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,his pocket-book and handed her a card. “Herr Regierungsrat. . . .” He,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"had a title! Well, it was _bound_ to be all right! So after that the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,little governess gave herself up to the excitement of being really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"abroad, to looking out and reading the foreign advertisement signs, to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,being told about the places they came to—having her attention and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,enjoyment looked after by the charming old grandfather—until they,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,reached Munich and the Hauptbahnhof. “Porter! Porter!” He found her a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"porter, disposed of his own luggage in a few words, guided her through",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the bewildering crowd out of the station down the clean white steps,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,into the white road to the hotel. He explained who she was to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"manager as though all this had been bound to happen, and then for one",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,moment her little hand lost itself in the big brown suède ones. “I will,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,call for you at ten o’clock.” He was gone.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“This way, Fräulein,” said a waiter, who had been dodging behind the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"manager’s back, all eyes and ears for the strange couple. She followed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,him up two flights of stairs into a dark bedroom. He dashed down her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dress-basket and pulled up a clattering, dusty blind. Ugh! what an",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ugly, cold room—what enormous furniture! Fancy spending the day in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,here! “Is this the room Frau Arnholdt ordered?” asked the little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,governess. The waiter had a curious way of staring as if there was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"something _funny_ about her. He pursed up his lips about to whistle,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and then changed his mind. “_Gewiss_,” he said. Well, why didn’t he go?",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Why did he stare so? “_Gehen Sie,_” said the little governess, with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"frigid English simplicity. His little eyes, like currants, nearly",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"popped out of his doughy cheeks. “_Gehen Sie sofort,_” she repeated",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"icily. At the door he turned. “And the gentleman,” said he, “shall I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,show the gentleman upstairs when he comes?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Over the white streets big white clouds fringed with silver—and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sunshine everywhere. Fat, fat coachmen driving fat cabs; funny women",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with little round hats cleaning the tramway lines; people laughing and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pushing against one another; trees on both sides of the streets and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"everywhere you looked almost, immense fountains; a noise of laughing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,from the footpaths or the middle of the streets or the open windows.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And beside her, more beautifully brushed than ever, with a rolled",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"umbrella in one hand and yellow gloves instead of brown ones, her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"grandfather who had asked her to spend the day. She wanted to run, she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wanted to hang on his arm, she wanted to cry every minute, “Oh, I am so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"frightfully happy!” He guided her across the roads, stood still while",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she “looked,” and his kind eyes beamed on her and he said “just",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,whatever you wish.” She ate two white sausages and two little rolls of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fresh bread at eleven o’clock in the morning and she drank some beer,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"which he told her wasn’t intoxicating, wasn’t at all like English beer,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,out of a glass like a flower vase. And then they took a cab and really,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she must have seen thousands and thousands of wonderful classical,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,pictures in about a quarter of an hour! “I shall have to think them,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,over when I am alone.” . . . But when they came out of the picture,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,gallery it was raining. The grandfather unfurled his umbrella and held,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it over the little governess. They started to walk to the restaurant,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"for lunch. She, very close beside him so that he should have some of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the umbrella, too. “It goes easier,” he remarked in a detached way, “if",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"you take my arm, Fräulein. And besides it is the custom in Germany.” So",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,she took his arm and walked beside him while he pointed out the famous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"statues, so interested that he quite forgot to put down the umbrella",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,even when the rain was long over.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"After lunch they went to a café to hear a gipsy band, but she did not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,like that at all. Ugh! such horrible men where there with heads like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"eggs and cuts on their faces, so she turned her chair and cupped her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,burning cheeks in her hands and watched her old friend instead. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Then they went to the Englischer Garten.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I wonder what the time is,” asked the little governess. “My watch has",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,stopped. I forgot to wind it in the train last night. We’ve seen such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lot of things that I feel it must be quite late.” “Late!” He stopped in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,front of her laughing and shaking his head in a way she had begun to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"know. “Then you have not really enjoyed yourself. Late! Why, we have",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"not had any ice cream yet!” “Oh, but I have enjoyed myself,” she cried,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"distressed, “more than I can possibly say. It has been wonderful! Only",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Frau Arnholdt is to be at the hotel at six and I ought to be there by,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,five.” “So you shall. After the ice cream I shall put you into a cab,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and you can go there comfortably.” She was happy again. The chocolate,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ice cream melted—melted in little sips a long way down. The shadows of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the trees danced on the table cloths, and she sat with her back safely",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,turned to the ornamental clock that pointed to twenty-five minutes to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seven. “Really and truly,” said the little governess earnestly, “this",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,has been the happiest day of my life. I’ve never even imagined such a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,day.” In spite of the ice cream her grateful baby heart glowed with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,love for the fairy grandfather.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,So they walked out of the garden down a long alley. The day was nearly,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"over. “You see those big buildings opposite,” said the old man. “The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,third storey—that is where I live. I and the old housekeeper who looks,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,after me.” She was very interested. “Now just before I find a cab for,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"you, will you come and see my little ‘home’ and let me give you a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bottle of the attar of roses I told you about in the train? For,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,remembrance?” She would love to. “I’ve never seen a bachelor’s flat in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"my life,” laughed the little governess.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The passage was quite dark. “Ah, I suppose my old woman has gone out to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,buy me a chicken. One moment.” He opened a door and stood aside for her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to pass, a little shy but curious, into a strange room. She did not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,know quite what to say. It wasn’t pretty. In a way it was very ugly—but,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"neat, and, she supposed, comfortable for such an old man. “Well, what",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,do you think of it?” He knelt down and took from a cupboard a round,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tray with two pink glasses and a tall pink bottle. “Two little bedrooms,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"beyond,” he said gaily, “and a kitchen. It’s enough, eh?” “Oh, quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,enough.” “And if ever you should be in Munich and care to spend a day,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"or two—why there is always a little nest—a wing of a chicken, and a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"salad, and an old man delighted to be your host once more and many many",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"times, dear little Fräulein!” He took the stopper out of the bottle and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,poured some wine into the two pink glasses. His hand shook and the wine,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,spilled over the tray. It was very quiet in the room. She said: “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,think I ought to go now.” “But you will have a tiny glass of wine with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"me—just one before you go?” said the old man. “No, really no. I never",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,drink wine. I—I have promised never to touch wine or anything like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that.” And though he pleaded and though she felt dreadfully rude,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"especially when he seemed to take it to heart so, she was quite",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"determined. “No, _really_, please.” “Well, will you just sit down on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the sofa for five minutes and let me drink your health?” The little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,governess sat down on the edge of the red velvet couch and he sat down,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,beside her and drank her health at a gulp. “Have you really been happy,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to-day?” asked the old man, turning round, so close beside her that she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,felt his knee twitching against hers. Before she could answer he held,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her hands. “And are you going to give me one little kiss before you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"go?” he asked, drawing her closer still.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was a dream! It wasn’t true! It wasn’t the same old man at all. Ah,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"how horrible! The little governess stared at him in terror. “No, no,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"no!” she stammered, struggling out of his hands. “One little kiss. A",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"kiss. What is it? Just a kiss, dear little Fräulein. A kiss.” He pushed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his face forward, his lips smiling broadly; and how his little blue",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,eyes gleamed behind the spectacles! “Never—never. How can you!” She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sprang up, but he was too quick and he held her against the wall,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pressed against her his hard old body and his twitching knee and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"though she shook her head from side to side, distracted, kissed her on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the mouth. On the mouth! Where not a soul who wasn’t a near relation,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,had ever kissed her before. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She ran, ran down the street until she found a broad road with tram",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lines and a policeman standing in the middle like a clockwork doll. “I,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"want to get a tram to the Hauptbahnhof,” sobbed the little governess.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Fräulein?” She wrung her hands at him. “The Hauptbahnhof.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"There—there’s one now,” and while he watched very much surprised, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"little girl with her hat on one side, crying without a handkerchief,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sprang on to the tram—not seeing the conductor’s eyebrows, nor hearing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the _hochwohlgebildete Dame_ talking her over with a scandalized,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"friend. She rocked herself and cried out loud and said “Ah, ah!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pressing her hands to her mouth. “She has been to the dentist,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shrilled a fat old woman, too stupid to be uncharitable. “_Na, sagen",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Sie ’mal_, what toothache! The child hasn’t one left in her mouth.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,While the tram swung and jangled through a world full of old men with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,twitching knees.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,When the little governess reached the hall of the Hotel Grunewald the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,same waiter who had come into her room in the morning was standing by,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"table, polishing a tray of glasses. The sight of the little governess",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,seemed to fill him out with some inexplicable important content. He was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"ready for her question; his answer came pat and suave. “Yes, Fräulein,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the lady has been here. I told her that you had arrived and gone out,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,again immediately with a gentleman. She asked me when you were coming,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,back again—but of course I could not say. And then she went to the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"manager.” He took up a glass from the table, held it up to the light,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"looked at it with one eye closed, and started polishing it with a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"corner of his apron. “. . . ?” “Pardon, Fräulein? Ach, no, Fräulein.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The manager could tell her nothing—nothing.” He shook his head and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,smiled at the brilliant glass. “Where is the lady now?” asked the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"little governess, shuddering so violently that she had to hold her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"handkerchief up to her mouth. “How should I know?” cried the waiter,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and as he swooped past her to pounce upon a new arrival his heart beat,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,so hard against his ribs that he nearly chuckled aloud. “That’s it!,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,that’s it!” he thought. “That will show her.” And as he swung the new,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,arrival’s box on to his shoulders—hoop!—as though he were a giant and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the box a feather, he minced over again the little governess’s words,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“_Gehen Sie. Gehen Sie sofort._ Shall I! Shall I!” he shouted to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,himself.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,From eight o’clock in the morning until about half-past eleven Monica,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Tyrell suffered from her nerves, and suffered so terribly that these",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hours were—agonizing, simply. It was not as though she could control",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them. “Perhaps if I were ten years younger . . .” she would say. For,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,now that she was thirty-three she had queer little way of referring to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her age on all occasions, of looking at her friends with grave,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"childish eyes and saying: “Yes, I remember how twenty years ago . . .”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,or of drawing Ralph’s attention to the girls—real girls—with lovely,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,youthful arms and throats and swift hesitating movements who sat near,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,them in restaurants. “Perhaps if I were ten years younger . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Why don’t you get Marie to sit outside your door and absolutely forbid,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,anybody to come near your room until you ring your bell?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, if it were as simple as that!” She threw her little gloves down",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and pressed her eyelids with her fingers in the way he knew so well.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“But in the first place I’d be so conscious of Marie sitting there,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Marie shaking her finger at Rudd and Mrs. Moon, Marie as a kind of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cross between a wardress and a nurse for mental cases! And then,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there’s the post. One can’t get over the fact that the post comes, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"once it has come, who—who—could wait until eleven for the letters?”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"His eyes grew bright; he quickly, lightly clasped her. “_My_ letters,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,darling?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Perhaps,” she drawled, softly, and she drew her hand over his reddish",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hair, smiling too, but thinking: “Heavens! What a stupid thing to say!”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But this morning she had been awakened by one great slam of the front,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"door. Bang. The flat shook. What was it? She jerked up in bed,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,clutching the eiderdown; her heart beat. What could it be? Then she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"heard voices in the passage. Marie knocked, and, as the door opened,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"with a sharp tearing rip out flew the blind and the curtains,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stiffening, flapping, jerking. The tassel of the blind knocked—knocked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"against the window. “Eh-h, _voilà!_” cried Marie, setting down the tray",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and running. “_C’est le vent, Madame. C’est un vent insupportable._”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Up rolled the blind; the window went up with a jerk; a whitey-greyish,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,light filled the room. Monica caught a glimpse of a huge pale sky and a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cloud like a torn shirt dragging across before she hid her eyes with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her sleeve.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Marie! the curtains! Quick, the curtains!” Monica fell back into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"bed and then “Ring-ting-a-ping-ping, ring-ting-a-ping-ping.” It was the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,telephone. The limit of her suffering was reached; she grew quite calm.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Go and see, Marie.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“It is Monsieur. To know if Madame will lunch at Princes’ at one-thirty,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to-day.” Yes, it was Monsieur himself. Yes, he had asked that the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"message be given to Madame immediately. Instead of replying, Monica put",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her cup down and asked Marie in a small wondering voice what time it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,was. It was half-past nine. She lay still and half closed her eyes.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Tell Monsieur I cannot come,” she said gently. But as the door shut,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"anger—anger suddenly gripped her close, close, violent, half strangling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her. How dared he? How dared Ralph do such a thing when he knew how,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,agonizing her nerves were in the morning! Hadn’t she explained and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"described and even—though lightly, of course; she couldn’t say such a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,thing directly—given him to understand that this was the one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,unforgivable thing.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And then to choose this frightful windy morning. Did he think it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"just a fad of hers, a little feminine folly to be laughed at and tossed",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"aside? Why, only last night she had said: “Ah, but you must take me",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seriously, too.” And he had replied: “My darling, you’ll not believe",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"me, but I know you infinitely better than you know yourself. Every",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"delicate thought and feeling I bow to, I treasure. Yes, laugh! I love",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the way your lip lifts”—and he had leaned across the table—“I don’t,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,care who sees that I adore all of you. I’d be with you on mountain-top,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and have all the searchlights of the world play upon us.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Heavens!” Monica almost clutched her head. Was it possible he had,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,really said that? How incredible men were! And she had loved him—how,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,could she have loved a man who talked like that. What had she been,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"doing ever since that dinner party months ago, when he had seen her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,home and asked if he might come and “see again that slow Arabian,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"smile”? Oh, what nonsense—what utter nonsense—and yet she remembered at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the time a strange deep thrill unlike anything she had ever felt,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Coal! Coal! Coal! Old iron! Old iron! Old iron!” sounded from below.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,It was all over. Understand her? He had understood nothing. That,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ringing her up on a windy morning was immensely significant. Would he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,understand that? She could almost have laughed. “You rang me up when,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the person who understood me simply couldn’t have.” It was the end. And,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,when Marie said: “Monsieur replied he would be in the vestibule in case,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Madame changed her mind,” Monica said: “No, not verbena, Marie.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Carnations. Two handfuls.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"A wild white morning, a tearing, rocking wind. Monica sat down before",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the mirror. She was pale. The maid combed back her dark hair—combed it,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"all back—and her face was like a mask, with pointed eyelids and dark",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,red lips. As she stared at herself in the blueish shadowy glass she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"suddenly felt—oh, the strangest, most tremendous excitement filling her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"slowly, slowly, until she wanted to fling out her arms, to laugh, to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"scatter everything, to shock Marie, to cry: “I’m free. I’m free. I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"free as the wind.” And now all this vibrating, trembling, exciting,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flying world was hers. It was her kingdom. No, no, she belonged to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,nobody but Life.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That will do, Marie,” she stammered. “My hat, my coat, my bag. And now",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"get me a taxi.” Where was she going? Oh, anywhere. She could not stand",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"this silent flat, noiseless Marie, this ghostly, quiet, feminine",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"interior. She must be out; she must be driving quickly—anywhere,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,anywhere.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“The taxi is there, Madame.” As she pressed open the big outer doors of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the flats the wild wind caught her and floated her across the pavement.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Where to? She got in, and smiling radiantly at the cross, cold-looking",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"driver, she told him to take her to her hairdresser’s. What would she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,have done without her hairdresser? Whenever Monica had nowhere else to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,go to or nothing on earth to do she drove there. She might just have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her hair waved, and by that time she’d have thought out a plan. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"cross, cold driver drove at a tremendous pace, and she let herself be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hurled from side to side. She wished he would go faster and faster. Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to be free of Princes’ at one-thirty, of being the tiny kitten in the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"swansdown basket, of being the Arabian, and the grave, delighted child",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and the little wild creature. . . . “Never again,” she cried aloud,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"clenching her small fist. But the cab had stopped, and the driver was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,standing holding the door open for her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,The hairdresser’s shop was warm and glittering. It smelled of soap and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,burnt paper and wallflower brilliantine. There was Madame behind the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"counter, round, fat, white, her head like a powder-puff rolling on a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,black satin pin-cushion. Monica always had the feeling that they loved,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her in this shop and understood her—the real her—far better than many,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"of her friends did. She was her real self here, and she and Madame had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,often talked—quite strangely—together. Then there was George who did,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her hair, young, dark, slender George. She was really fond of him.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,But to-day—how curious! Madame hardly greeted her. Her face was whiter,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"than ever, but rims of bright red showed round her blue bead eyes, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"even the rings on her pudgy fingers did not flash. They were cold,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"dead, like chips of glass. When she called through the wall-telephone",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to George there was a note in her voice that had never been there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"before. But Monica would not believe this. No, she refused to. It was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"just her imagination. She sniffed greedily the warm, scented air, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,passed behind the velvet curtain into the small cubicle.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Her hat and jacket were off and hanging from the peg, and still George",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,did not come. This was the first time he had ever not been there to,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hold the chair for her, to take her hat and hang up her bag, dangling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,it in his fingers as though it were something he’d never seen,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,before—something fairy. And how quiet the shop was! There was not a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"sound even from Madame. Only the wind blew, shaking the old house; the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"wind hooted, and the portraits of Ladies of the Pompadour Period looked",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"down and smiled, cunning and sly. Monica wished she hadn’t come. Oh,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,what a mistake to have come! Fatal. Fatal. Where was George? If he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,didn’t appear the next moment she would go away. She took off the white,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kimono. She didn’t want to look at herself any more. When she opened a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,big pot of cream on the glass shelf her fingers trembled. There was a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,tugging feeling at her heart as though her happiness—her marvellous,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,happiness—were trying to get free.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“I’ll go. I’ll not stay.” She took down her hat. But just at that,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moment steps sounded, and, looking in the mirror, she saw George bowing",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,in the doorway. How queerly he smiled! It was the mirror of course. She,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"turned round quickly. His lips curled back in a sort of grin,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and—wasn’t he unshaved?—he looked almost green in the face.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very sorry to have kept you waiting,” he mumbled, sliding, gliding",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,forward.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Oh, no, she wasn’t going to stay. “I’m afraid,” she began. But he had",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lighted the gas and laid the tongs across, and was holding out the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,kimono.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“It’s a wind,” he said. Monica submitted. She smelled his fresh young",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"fingers pinning the jacket under her chin. “Yes, there is a wind,” said",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she, sinking back into the chair. And silence fell. George took out the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pins in his expert way. Her hair tumbled back, but he didn’t hold it as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"he usually did, as though to feel how fine and soft and heavy it was.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He didn’t say it “was in a lovely condition.” He let it fall, and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"taking a brush out of a drawer, he coughed faintly, cleared his throat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and said dully: “Yes, it’s a pretty strong one, I should say it was.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"She had no reply to make. The brush fell on her hair. Oh, oh, how",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"mournful, how mournful! It fell quick and light, it fell like leaves;",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and then it fell heavy, tugging like the tugging at her heart. “That’s",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"enough,” she cried, shaking herself free.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Did I do it too much?” asked George. He crouched over the tongs. “I’m,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sorry.” There came the smell of burnt paper—the smell she loved—and he,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"swung the hot tongs round in his hand, staring before him. “I shouldn’t",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"be surprised if it rained.” He took up a piece of her hair, when—she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,couldn’t bear it any longer—she stopped him. She looked at him; she saw,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,herself looking at him in the white kimono like a nun. “Is there,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,something the matter here? Has something happened?” But George gave a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"half shrug and a grimace. “Oh, no, Madame. Just a little occurrence.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And he took up the piece of hair again. But, oh, she wasn’t deceived.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"That was it. Something awful had happened. The silence—really, the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,silence seemed to come drifting down like flakes of snow. She shivered.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was cold in the little cubicle, all cold and glittering. The nickel",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,taps and jets and sprays looked somehow almost malignant. The wind,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"rattled the window-frame; a piece of iron banged, and the young man",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"went on changing the tongs, crouching over her. Oh, how terrifying Life",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was, thought Monica. How dreadful. It is the loneliness which is so",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"appalling. We whirl along like leaves, and nobody knows—nobody cares",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"where we fall, in what black river we float away. The tugging feeling",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seemed to rise into her throat. It ached, ached; she longed to cry.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“That will do,” she whispered. “Give me the pins.” As he stood beside",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her, so submissive, so silent, she nearly dropped her arms and sobbed.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She couldn’t bear any more. Like a wooden man the gay young George,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"still slid, glided, handed her her hat and veil, took the note, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,brought back the change. She stuffed it into her bag. Where was she,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,going now?,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"George took a brush. “There is a little powder on your coat,” he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"murmured. He brushed it away. And then suddenly he raised himself and,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"looking at Monica, gave a strange wave with the brush and said: “The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"truth is, Madame, since you are an old customer—my little daughter died",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,this morning. A first child”—and then his white face crumpled like,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"paper, and he turned his back on her and began brushing the cotton",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"kimono. “Oh, oh,” Monica began to cry. She ran out of the shop into the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"taxi. The driver, looking furious, swung off the seat and slammed the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,door again. “Where to?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Princes’,” she sobbed. And all the way there she saw nothing but a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tiny wax doll with a feather of gold hair, lying meek, its tiny hands",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and feet crossed. And then just before she came to Princes’ she saw a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flower shop full of white flowers. Oh, what a perfect thought.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Lilies-of-the-valley, and white pansies, double white violets and white",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,velvet ribbon. . . . From an unknown friend. . . . From one who,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,understands. . . . For a Little Girl. . . . She tapped against the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"window, but the driver did not hear; and, anyway, they were at Princes’",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,already.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield

44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was his fault, wholly and solely his fault, that they had missed the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,train. What if the idiotic hotel people had refused to produce the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,bill? Wasn’t that simply because he hadn’t impressed upon the waiter at,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,lunch that they must have it by two o’clock? Any other man would have,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sat there and refused to move until they handed it over. But no! His,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,exquisite belief in human nature had allowed him to get up and expect,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"one of those idiots to bring it to their room. . . . And then, when the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"_voiture_ did arrive, while they were still (Oh, Heavens!) waiting for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"change, why hadn’t he seen to the arrangement of the boxes so that they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"could, at least, have started the moment the money had come? Had he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"expected her to go outside, to stand under the awning in the heat and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,point with her parasol? Very amusing picture of English domestic life.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Even when the driver had been told how fast he had to drive he had paid,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"no attention whatsoever—just smiled. “Oh,” she groaned, “if she’d been",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"a driver she couldn’t have stopped smiling herself at the absurd,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,ridiculous way he was urged to hurry.” And she sat back and imitated,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his voice: “_Allez, vite, vite_”—and begged the driver’s pardon for",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,troubling him. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,And then the station—unforgettable—with the sight of the jaunty little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,train shuffling away and those hideous children waving from the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"windows. “Oh, why am I made to bear these things? Why am I exposed to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"them? . . .” The glare, the flies, while they waited, and he and the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stationmaster put their heads together over the time-table, trying to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"find this other train, which, of course, they wouldn’t catch. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"people who’d gathered round, and the woman who’d held up that baby with",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"that awful, awful head. . . . “Oh, to care as I care—to feel as I feel,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,and never to be saved anything—never to know for one moment what it was,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to . . . to . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Her voice had changed. It was shaking now—crying now. She fumbled with,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her bag, and produced from its little maw a scented handkerchief. She",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"put up her veil and, as though she were doing it for somebody else,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"pitifully, as though she were saying to somebody else: “I know, my",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"darling,” she pressed the handkerchief to her eyes.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The little bag, with its shiny, silvery jaws open, lay on her lap. He",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"could see her powder-puff, her rouge stick, a bundle of letters, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"phial of tiny black pills like seeds, a broken cigarette, a mirror,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,white ivory tablets with lists on them that had been heavily scored,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,through. He thought: “In Egypt she would be buried with those things.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"They had left the last of the houses, those small straggling houses",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,with bits of broken pot flung among the flower-beds and half-naked hens,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,scratching round the doorsteps. Now they were mounting a long steep,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,road that wound round the hill and over into the next bay. The horses,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stumbled, pulling hard. Every five minutes, every two minutes the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,driver trailed the whip across them. His stout back was solid as wood;,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"there were boils on his reddish neck, and he wore a new, a shining new",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,straw hat. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"There was a little wind, just enough wind to blow to satin the new",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"leaves on the fruit trees, to stroke the fine grass, to turn to silver",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the smoky olives—just enough wind to start in front of the carriage a,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"whirling, twirling snatch of dust that settled on their clothes like",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the finest ash. When she took out her powder-puff the powder came,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flying over them both.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, the dust,” she breathed, “the disgusting, revolting dust.” And she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,put down her veil and lay back as if overcome.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Why don’t you put up your parasol?” he suggested. It was on the front,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"seat, and he leaned forward to hand it to her. At that she suddenly sat",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,upright and blazed again.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Please leave my parasol alone! I don’t want my parasol! And anyone who,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was not utterly insensitive would know that I’m far, far too exhausted",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,to hold up a parasol. And with a wind like this tugging at it. . . .,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Put it down at once,” she flashed, and then snatched the parasol from",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"him, tossed it into the crumpled hood behind, and subsided, panting.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Another bend of the road, and down the hill there came a troop of",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"little children, shrieking and giggling, little girls with sun-bleached",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hair, little boys in faded soldiers’ caps. In their hands they carried",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"flowers—any kind of flowers—grabbed by the head, and these they",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"offered, running beside the carriage. Lilac, faded lilac, greeny-white",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"snowballs, one arum lily, a handful of hyacinths. They thrust the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,flowers and their impish faces into the carriage; one even threw into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,her lap a bunch of marigolds. Poor little mice! He had his hand in his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,trouser pocket before her. “For Heaven’s sake don’t give them anything.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"Oh, how typical of you! Horrid little monkeys! Now they’ll follow us",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,all the way. Don’t encourage them; you _would_ encourage beggars”; and,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"she hurled the bunch out of the carriage with, “Well, do it when I’m",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"not there, please.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"He saw the queer shock on the children’s faces. They stopped running,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"lagged behind, and then they began to shout something, and went on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,shouting until the carriage had rounded yet another bend.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, how many more are there before the top of the hill is reached? The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,horses haven’t trotted once. Surely it isn’t necessary for them to walk,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the whole way.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“We shall be there in a minute now,” he said, and took out his",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,cigarette-case. At that she turned round towards him. She clasped her,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"hands and held them against her breast; her dark eyes looked immense,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"imploring, behind her veil; her nostrils quivered, she bit her lip, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"her head shook with a little nervous spasm. But when she spoke, her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"voice was quite weak and very, very calm.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I want to ask you something. I want to beg something of you,” she",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"said. “I’ve asked you hundreds and hundreds of times before, but you’ve",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"forgotten. It’s such a little thing, but if you knew what it meant to",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,me. . . .” She pressed her hands together. “But you can’t know. No,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"human creature could know and be so cruel.” And then, slowly,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"deliberately, gazing at him with those huge, sombre eyes: “I beg and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,implore you for the last time that when we are driving together you,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"won’t smoke. If you could imagine,” she said, “the anguish I suffer",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,when that smoke comes floating across my face. . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Very well,” he said. “I won’t. I forgot.” And he put the case back.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Oh, no,” said she, and almost began to laugh, and put the back of her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,hand across her eyes. “You couldn’t have forgotten. Not that.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"The wind came, blowing stronger. They were at the top of the hill.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Hoy-yip-yip-yip,” cried the driver. They swung down the road that fell",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"into a small valley, skirted the sea coast at the bottom of it, and",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,then coiled over a gentle ridge on the other side. Now there were,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"houses again, blue-shuttered against the heat, with bright burning",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"gardens, with geranium carpets flung over the pinkish walls. The",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,coast-line was dark; on the edge of the sea a white silky fringe just,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stirred. The carriage swung down the hill, bumped, shook. “Yi-ip,”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"shouted the driver. She clutched the sides of the seat, she closed her",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"eyes, and he knew she felt this was happening on purpose; this swinging",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and bumping, this was all done—and he was responsible for it,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,somehow—to spite her because she had asked if they couldn’t go a little,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,faster. But just as they reached the bottom of the valley there was one,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"tremendous lurch. The carriage nearly overturned, and he saw her eyes",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"blaze at him, and she positively hissed, “I suppose you are enjoying",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,this?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,They went on. They reached the bottom of the valley. Suddenly she stood,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,up. “_Cocher! Cocher! Arrêtez-vous!_” She turned round and looked into,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the crumpled hood behind. “I knew it,” she exclaimed. “I knew it. I",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"heard it fall, and so did you, at that last bump.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“What? Where?”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“My parasol. It’s gone. The parasol that belonged to my mother. The,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,parasol that I prize more than—more than . . .” She was simply beside,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"herself. The driver turned round, his gay, broad face smiling.",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“I, too, heard something,” said he, simply and gaily. “But I thought as",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,Monsieur and Madame said nothing . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“There. You hear that. Then you must have heard it too. So _that_,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,accounts for the extraordinary smile on your face. . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Look here,” he said, “it can’t be gone. If it fell out it will be",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,there still. Stay where you are. I’ll fetch it.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But she saw through that. Oh, how she saw through it! “No, thank you.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"And she bent her spiteful, smiling eyes upon him, regardless of the",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"driver. “I’ll go myself. I’ll walk back and find it, and trust you not",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"to follow. For”—knowing the driver did not understand, she spoke",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"softly, gently—“if I don’t escape from you for a minute I shall go",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,mad.”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,She stepped out of the carriage. “My bag.” He handed it to her.,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,“Madame prefers . . .”,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"But the driver had already swung down from his seat, and was seated on",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,the parapet reading a small newspaper. The horses stood with hanging,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"heads. It was still. The man in the carriage stretched himself out,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,folded his arms. He felt the sun beat on his knees. His head was sunk,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"on his breast. “Hish, hish,” sounded from the sea. The wind sighed in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the valley and was quiet. He felt himself, lying there, a hollow man, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"parched, withered man, as it were, of ashes. And the sea sounded,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"“Hish, hish.”",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"It was then that he saw the tree, that he was conscious of its presence",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"just inside a garden gate. It was an immense tree with a round, thick",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,silver stem and a great arc of copper leaves that gave back the light,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"and yet were sombre. There was something beyond the tree—a whiteness, a",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"softness, an opaque mass, half-hidden—with delicate pillars. As he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,looked at the tree he felt his breathing die away and he became part of,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the silence. It seemed to grow, it seemed to expand in the quivering",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"heat until the great carved leaves hid the sky, and yet it was",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,motionless. Then from within its depths or from beyond there came the,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,sound of a woman’s voice. A woman was singing. The warm untroubled,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"voice floated upon the air, and it was all part of the silence as he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"was part of it. Suddenly, as the voice rose, soft, dreaming, gentle, he",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,knew that it would come floating to him from the hidden leaves and his,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,peace was shattered. What was happening to him? Something stirred in,The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his breast. Something dark, something unbearable and dreadful pushed in",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"his bosom, and like a great weed it floated, rocked . . . it was warm,",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"stifling. He tried to struggle to tear at it, and at the same",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"moment—all was over. Deep, deep, he sank into the silence, staring at",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
44385,"the tree and waiting for the voice that came floating, falling, until",The Garden Party,Katherine Mansfield
